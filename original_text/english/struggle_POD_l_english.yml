 pod_french_struggle.1007.t:0 "The Queen of Occitania"
 pod_french_struggle.1007.desc:0 "The powerful Esclarmonde has become the rallying point of Occitan Cainites since the Albigensian Crusade started. Her dogged resistance against both the Inquisition and the Northern French has made her Court de facto independent of Parisian's control.\nThe 'black queen' is a mysterious figure, and many are said to have pledged undying loyalty to her after a mere glance. This is why you are worried about this unexpected invitation to Toulouse suddenly showing up to your door..."
 pod_french_struggle.1007.a:0 "Surely, I can resist her spell!"
 pod_french_struggle.1007.b:0 "Better not risk it."
 pod_french_struggle.1007.c:0 "I know a thing or two about enthrallment as well..."
 french_struggle_taunt_tooltip:0 "No, you can't."
 
 pod_french_struggle.1008.t:0 "The Sun God Bears Gifts"
 pod_french_struggle.1008.desc:0 "Mithras, the powerful ruler of the Baronies of Avalon, has shown little interest in France during the time of Alexander's rule. But now that the country is destabilized by his exile, and that English mortals are making inroads in it as well, it seems that the Sun God has new plans.\nStarting a lavish grand tour in France, Mithras has been stopping by many cities, impressing their Cainite inhabitants with his sheer power and influence. You could make inroads so that Mithras comes by your city during his tour if you wish it. It would certainly reflect well on you and he is a generous guest. But the risk of falling under his spell is something to consider..."
 pod_french_struggle.1008.a:0 "I'm honored by your presence!"
 pod_french_struggle.1008.b:0 "Better not risk it."
 pod_french_struggle.1008.c:0 "Mithras is already my God! Surely he will help me?"
 
 pod_french_struggle.1009.t:0 "The Tyrant's Offer"
 pod_french_struggle.1009.desc:0 "The powerful Hardestadt of Germany is an oddity in the Cainite world. Coming from a shrouded lineage, he has managed to become the most important Ventrue of Europe despite his young age. Reputed for being a cunning and ruthless politician, he is also not known to mince words.\nHis sudden visit to your court comes as a shock but his offer is even more surprising. Bluntly honest, Hardestadt tells you that he has plans for France and you could be an asset in this endeavor. He offers you gold, a personal army and the recognition of your worth at his court if you were to agree on joining the Fiefs of the Black Cross."
 pod_french_struggle.1009.a:0 "An enticing offer..."
 pod_french_struggle.1009.b:0 "I don't trust him."

 pod_french_struggle.1010.t:0 "A Classic Conversation"
 pod_french_struggle.1010.desc:0 "One of the most influential Ventrue of Western Europe, Julia Antasia, has come to visit some of France's courts. She has many devoted followers in the region, all praising her levelheadedness and utopic vision of a democratic society for the Cainites.\nShe has stopped by your court since a couple of nights now and you must admit that her reputation isn't exaggerated. She is calm, composed and everything she says paint a vivid vision of a potentially great future for your kind. You can feel yourself being swayed more and more by this seemingly benign conversation between peers."
 pod_french_struggle.1010.a:0 "An interesting talk, nothing more."
 pod_french_struggle.1010.b:0 "She has some very good points..."
 pod_french_struggle.1010.c:0 "My lady, say no more, let me serve you!"

 pod_french_struggle.1011.t:0 "Poisoned Gift"
 pod_french_struggle.1011.desc:0 "As the Matriarch of the Courts of Love, Salianna is, at least nominally, the most important Cainite in France since Alexander's exile. Her rule is contested however and she is trying to secure it as best as she can since then.\nAs one of the influential ruler of the night in France, you are subject to some of her ploys for recognition. During the latest court session, she is trying to offer you a choice mortal to use as you see fit. Politically, accepting the gift means giving her credit as a liege rewarding a vassal, strengthening her position at your expense. On the other hand, this mortal seems indeed like an interesting one..."
 pod_french_struggle.1011.a:0 "I am honored, Matriarch."
 pod_french_struggle.1011.b:0 "You can keep your gifts."

 pod_french_struggle.1012.t:0 "Visitors from the South"
 pod_french_struggle.1012.desc:0 "The Iberian Lasombra were among the many outsiders trying to grab what influence they could in France after Alexander's exile. Their own trouble in the peninsula with their ongoing civil war soon put an end to their efforts. Still, some young Lasombra see opportunities in France's situation, perhaps to make their fortune before a triumphant return home.\nOne such mercenary group has come to offer their services to you recently. You could obviously refuse their proposal, but there is little doubt that they would then find another employer, perhaps even one of your competitors."
 pod_french_struggle.1012.a:0 "You are hired."
 pod_french_struggle.1012.b:0 "You are not."
