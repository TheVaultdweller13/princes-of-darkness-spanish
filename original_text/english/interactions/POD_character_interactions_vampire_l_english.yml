 confused_populace_modifier_desc: "The populace here has been confused by the amateurish use of a vampiric discipline." 

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.10.t: "Power of the Mind"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.10.desc: "Dominate is all about using your willpower against others to force them to do your bidding. As you are learning, you will have to start practicing on actual subjects to test your progress. Mortals would be an easy and relatively inconsequential choice, but you would need to dominate a lot of them to actually learn something as their willpower is on the weaker side. Or you could also try your newfound powers on one of your vassals, though they might not appreciate being used as a test subject of such invasive powers."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.10.a: "I know just the right person!"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.10.b: "Plenty of mortals to go around."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.11.t: "Mind Tricks"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.11.desc: "You are quite confident that you understand Dominate enough to use it now but your mentor insists otherwise. They say that you still need to be targeted by Dominate yourself to truly comprehend its effects.\nYou are quite dubious about this claim as it seems an underhanded way of messing with your mind. You could simply refuse their demands and enjoy your new powers but that would arose their suspicions, or their anger."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.11.a: "If you say it's safe..."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.11.b: "Thanks but no thanks."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.20.t: "Furry Friends and Foes"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.20.desc: "To learn Animalism, you must interact with animals. This isn't exactly a groundbreaking news but you still have to make a choice about how to do it. You could answer the call of the wilds and try your newfound powers on potentially threatening targets. Or you could simply flood your court with a host of domesticated animals to make it easier on yourself.\nThis second choice is likely to be controversial though, as not everyone enjoys forcing their way on a horde of cats and dogs before coming to the Elysium."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.20.a: "Snakes? Really?"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.20.b: "Way more accommodating than my courtiers."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.21.t: "Wild Side"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.21.desc: "Your mentor in Animalism is insisting that you properly get in touch with your inner beast by adopting the trappings of an animal yourself for a while using your newfound powers. You aren't especially fond of the idea because, as a ruler of the night, you are held to some standards of etiquette. The alternative would be to isolate yourself for a while to conclude your training which is less likely to leave you completely exposed at the very least."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.21.a: "I have nothing to hide!"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.21.b: "I just need a moment alone."

 court_tutor_mentoring_disc_tt: "Having a Court Tutor with high aptitude reduces the prestige cost of mentoring."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.30.t: "Mysterious Appeal"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.30.desc: "Learning Auspex means you have to juggle with a "sixth sense" that you didn't really consider before. Small actions take a deeper meaning, and even bribes of conversation can reveal great insight.\nAs such, you have taken to slow yourself and ponder more each of your actions and words. This has, in a roundabout way, made you appear somewhat aloof to your court, something you might wish to rectify. But mystery has an appeal of its own."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.30.a: "I see so much more."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.30.b: "I need to focus."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.31.t: "Seeing Too Much"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.31.desc: "Auspex is a complex discipline, opening the doors for a myriad of possibilities from simple spying to the exploration of unseen worlds. Such wonderful, and scary, possibilities can be a strain on the strongest of minds.\nWhile the hardest part is behind you now, you are still suffering from some headaches and crisis induced by sudden "flashes". Luckily, your mentor is still there and helps you control your newfound powers as time goes on."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.31.a: "I'm glad you are by my side."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.40.t: "Dodge!"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.40.desc: "Celerity is the discipline to, well, go fast and be quick. There are various ways to train such a skill and you were mostly thinking of a race and other physical exercises, but it seems your mentor has other plans. They are now throwing things at you with barely concealed glee while telling you to dodge.\nTo your credit, you are actually avoiding some of it at least."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.40.a: "That's not funny!"

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.41.t: "Run Vampire, Run!"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.41.desc: "Celerity is an exhilarating power to train most of the time as simply running very quickly around your city gives a great rush of power. It also leaves you somewhat dizzy and disoriented for a while though, as you then have to adapt back to the slow crawl of normal life. Your mentor is advising to pace yourself but it is not as easy as it sounds."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.41.a: "Gotta go fast!"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.41.b: "Gotta go faster!"

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.50.t: "Skulking Around"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.50.desc: "Obfuscate is the power to hide yourself and others from view. It is then obvious that, to train it properly, you have to put it to the test against other vampires actually trying to see you. Mortals won't do as they are too near sighted to see anything anyway, so you will have to take some risks.\nThis will likely have the unintended effect of propagating nasty rumors in the court about exactly "why" you are learning such an underhanded tool though..."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.50.a: "I'm not spying on you all, promise."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.51.t: "Threats Everywhere"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.51.desc: "Your newfound knowledge of Obfuscate allows you to learn much more about your courtiers as you can now spy on them unseen. Sadly, what you learn about them is mostly that you can't trust anyone as most of them are plotting some petty schemes or another. You are finding yourself looking behind your back even more than usual, now concerned that they are all here to get you.\nRealistically, they probably are."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.51.a: "Traitors, everywhere!"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.51.b: "I need to keep calm."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.51.c: "Nah, they are trustworthy people."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.51.d: "I knew it!"

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.60.t: "Punching Bags"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.60.desc: "Potence, as the power to punch things really hard, might be the easiest discipline to train. Just hit things.\nIt also might be the most exhilarating, as just letting loose once in a while can prove to be quite a boon to the often frustrated mind of a ruler of the night. So you punch bigger and bigger things to your heart's content with no worries for tomorrow night."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.60.a: "We don't need that wall! Punch!"

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.61.t: "Punching Diplomacy"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.61.desc: "Your newfound strength, thanks to Potence, has given you a skewed perspective about how issues can be solved, which is by hitting them very hard. Sadly, there is a limit about how much brute strength can be an answer all your problems and you are starting to hit it. You will soon have to return to the daily routine of plotting, court intrigue and boring diplomacy instead of running around acting like a demolition crew."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.61.a: "Just a little more!"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.61.b: "Time to return to the real world."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.70.t: "Loved by All"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.70.desc: "Presence is an intoxicating power to learn. Who wouldn't like the ability to make everyone love or even outright worship you? Your mentor is speaking words of caution, telling you of the after effects after you lose direct contact with the victims but you couldn't care less. Finally, all your subjects show the proper devotion they should have a long time ago!"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.70.a: "My greatness is recognized at last."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.71.t: "Love's Aftermath"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.71.desc: "You have now completed your learning of the Presence discipline which includes being more mindful of its drawbacks. While the ability to be respected and loved is certainly very powerful, it doesn't last for long after you lose contact with the victim which ends up leaving a very annoyed person behind. Nobody likes their feelings being toyed with supernatural powers.\nThe last few nights, you have used your new powers perhaps a little too frequently and earned some new enemies in the process. It might be time to make amends for your learning enthusiasm overreaching into other people's minds."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.71.a: "I just wanted you all to like me!"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.71.b: "They will get over it."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.80.t: "Finding Your Self"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.80.desc: "Protean is the ability to change yourself in various ways and shaping your outward appearance with few limits. While powerful, this makes it a tricky discipline to learn as you have grown quite accustomed to your physical form. An immortal like you never truly changes and being able to suddenly shift some parts of your body has made you more emotionally troubled than you would have first thought."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.80.a: "What does this truly mean?"

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.81.t: "Unfair Advantage"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.81.desc: "As you master the discipline of Protean, you find that it holds a lot of martial potential. Suddenly sprouting claws out of your hands can certainly turn the tide of a losing battle and you find yourself relying on such tactics more and more. Your mentor advises caution as this superiority feeling can be your downfall if you can't use Protean in a fight or if your adversary is prepared for it.\nBut maybe they are just jealous that you are learning so well?"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.81.a: "I'm great! That's all!"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.81.b: "A wise counsel."
 
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.90.t: "The Horror Above"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.90.desc: "Vicissitude is one of the most horrifying powers of the Cainites mostly because its applications often result in the death of the participating "test subjects". Mortals are plentiful anyway, so you think you can easily get away with experimenting on some while you learn these powers to get some practical experience. On the other hand, a wise Prince knows that the well being of the mortal community in their area can be an asset in itself so making sure to not take too much from it at a time also has merits."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.90.a: "I will take everything I need now."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.90.b: "I will experiment over a longer period of time."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.91.t: "The Horror Within"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.91.desc: "You are now competent enough in Vicissitude to feel more at ease using it without the help of your mentor. Still, you can't shake the feeling that something is just off with you since you learned this new power. It is hard to describe but it's almost as if someone else was wearing your own skin and trying to control you at times.\nIt is probably just your imagination playing tricks but you are still worried enough to consider investigating the matter more by yourself."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.91.a: "Nothing to worry about. Surely."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.91.b: "Why do I feel so... alien?"

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.100.t: "Hitting the Books"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.100.desc: "Blood Sorcery is a peculiar discipline to learn for vampires as it's not "innate" like all the others. It is instead a very ritualized practice with many ingredients to buy and recipes to follow. This will be a costly endeavor as trial and error is a fact of unlife when trying to understand such a complex discipline.\nTime to read books and prepare as best as you can to truly master the power of your unholy blood."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.100.a: "Book 1. Chapter 1. Page 1..."
 learning_mentoring_tt: "The higher your learning, the less costly it will be."
 
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.101.t: "Nighttime Readings"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.101.desc: "You have grasped enough of the base concept of Blood Sorcery to truly understand the depths of this discipline. There are no limits to what it can accomplish as new ways to harness the power of the blood are found all over the world with surprising speed. One being can never truly hope to master such a broad range of powers... but it certainly won't stop many trying.\nFascinated by these new discoveries, you are finding yourself more and more isolated from your court and your advisors are worrying that this might hamper your capacity to rule efficiently."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.101.a: "Back to the usual I suppose..."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.101.b: "So much more to learn!"

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.110.t: "Merely a Flesh Wound"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.110.desc: "Fortitude is the discipline that allows vampires to sustain wounds that would normally have easily killed mortals. To learn to properly understand it, the best way is simply to be hit hard until you can ignore the blows. You are somewhat dubious of your mentor's intentions but they have already started to punch you with barely concealed glee.\nClearly, it's all done for your benefit in the end."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.110.a: "I can take more!"

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.111.t: "Invincible?"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.111.desc: "After a couple days of intense training, you are now proficient in Fortitude enough to be confident in your ability to master it given time. Perhaps too confident actually, since Fortitude is known to give a (mostly false) feeling of invulnerability to its user. Many tales are told of overconfident Fortitude users reaching their limits and not having the time to regret it afterwards. This is the last thing your mentor warns you about, overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer after all."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.111.a: "I must stay humble."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.111.b: "True immortality, at last!"

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.120.t: "Surrounded by Falsehoods"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.120.desc: "You are taking quite easily to understand the discipline of Chimerstry. Making small illusions is not a very difficult affair and your mentor is helping coordinate your training.\nSomething is gnawing at your mind however. If understanding this is so easy, who is to say that it's not already extensively used by your foes? What is real and what is false?\nIn the first few nights after discovering this new power, you are struck by a frenzy of doing everything yourself since your own observations are truly the only ones you can trust."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.120.a: "Only I know the truth!"

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.121.t: "Truths and Illusions"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.121.desc: "While your training of Chimerstry is going well enough that you can do it on your own now, your mentor has became concerned with your growing paranoia about the potential that your foes are using such tactics against you. They are trying to teach you the limits of Chimerstry, making sure that you understand that a duplicity of such a scale is hardly realistic.\nYou are hearing their words and contemplating slowing down on your micromanagement efforts but you still aren't entirely convinced."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.121.a: "Maybe there are merits in this advice."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.121.b: "Another lie!"

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.130.t: "Not Alone in the Dark"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.130.desc: "Obtenebration, on the surface, seems like a relatively straightforward discipline, simply using shadows as tools or weapons. Your mentor quickly debunks this idea however and you understand that it is actually using the energy of a mysterious realm called the "Abyss". And sometimes the abyss fights back against your intrusion.\nYour first steps into this frightening new world are difficult, as it's clear that this abyss is populated by all manners of dangerous creatures very unhappy with your poking into their homes. It is as if the darkness itself wants you to perish... or join them."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.130.a: "I'm not afraid of the dark!"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.130.b: "I need a candle..."
 mentoring_slowed_tt: "Your mentoring will progress slower than usual."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.131.t: "Embracing the Dark"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.131.desc: "You have taken your first steps into the Abyss and managed to work the courage to use it for your own ends, completing your first forays into the Obtenebration discipline. Now that you are more familiar with it, you can't deny that this strange realm of darkness is somehow pulling you back in, something that many Lasombra are known to feel.\nEven now that your training is complete, you are eager to go back to it and learn more, even with all the dangers lurking in there."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.131.a: "We are children of the dark after all."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.131.b: "I'm a little scared to be honest."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.140.t: "Dark Nature"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.140.desc: "Daimonion is a discipline very much tied to the infernal. While it's not directly asking you to make a pact with demons, it's as if you are standing very close to the edge of the precipice. The simple fact of trying to understand it has started to change your very nature. You are finding yourself becoming more callous, easily snapping into snarky or outright cruel comments more than usual.\nYou could make a conscious effort to amend this change or just embrace this new you."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.140.a: "I'm better than this."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.140.b: "Fools, all of them!"

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.141.t: "Dark Thoughts"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.141.desc: "You have finished your early training of Daimonion and you already want more. The power this discipline hints at is addictive and cajoles you into embracing your darker nature to unlock all of its secrets. Accepting such a change would likely lead to some complications about the way you rule your domain but, sometimes, the quick and easy answer is the most alluring one."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.141.a: "These fools won't slow me down!"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.141.b: "I need to stay alone for a while."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.150.t: "Allure of the Serpent"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.150.desc: "Serpentis is the discipline to tempt others with the forbidden, the wrong, the apple in the garden of Eden. A powerful tool to be sure, learning it requires some deep instruction from your mentor that takes a guilty pleasure from showing you Serpentis' strength, making you doubt everything you once held true. All part of the process of course, no unseemly intention behind that..."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.150.a: "Looking in the eyes of the serpent..."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.150.b: "It's tempting..."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.150.c: "My faith is strong!"

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.151.t: "Indulging Serpent"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.151.desc: "One of Serpentis' main appeal as a discipline is the ability to change forms, mostly towards the serpentine kind. You have been training this part well enough recently, actually enjoying the relief from your night to night hardships as you slither around in a snake form.\nThis isn't the most prestigious way of ruling your domain however and your vassals might soon start to snicker about their strange ruler if you don't stop this training regimen."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.151.a: "Slithering, slithering..."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.151.b: "Annoying courtiers as usual."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.160.t: "The Beast Inside"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.160.desc: "Abombwe utilizes the vampire's close connection to and control over their own Beasts (and that of others), as well as channel the Beast's power for various purposes. This made it a taxing discipline to learn as the Beast is not easily controlled or cowed, resisting with all its might your attempts at corralling it. Despite your mentor's help, your first tries are basically shots in the dark."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.160.a: "Hold! Hold!"

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.161.t: "Boiling Anger"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.161.desc: "You have gotten better at mastering the Abombwe discipline but it has taken several nights of experiments and trials. These have resulted in some... incidents when you toyed a little too much with the Beast of some of your courtiers. As such, you find yourself short a few guards which has left your domain less secure than usual. Time will solve the issue on its own, but you could be interested in speeding up the process."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.161.a: "A few more or a few less..."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.161.b: "Hire new ones."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.170.t: "Seeing Dead People"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.170.desc: "Necromancy is the discipline that tries to understand, and sometimes control, death be it physical or spiritual. To learn it some gruesome practices are required, from stalking spooky cemeteries to trying to commune with the wraiths of the [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('shadowlands','Underworld')]. You already know that your nightmares in the coming days will be filled with ghostly forms and other spectral hallucinations."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.170.a: "Ghosts and vampires?"

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.171.t: "Dead Heart"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.171.desc: "Learning Necromancy was a taxing affair these past few nights. You look paler than usual and the company of (un)living being has been getting on your nerves enough for you to snap at them multiple times recently. They finally got the message and left you alone to perfect your understanding of the secrets of the dead but you find yourself wandering if you have gone too far. A ruler of the night like yourself isn't supposed to eternally roam their castle alone is it?"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.171.a: "The dead walk with me, it's enough."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.171.b: "I will invite everyone back."
 
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.180.t: "Lost in Time"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.180.desc: "Temporis is thought to be the true discipline of the early clan Brujah before it "devolved" into Celerity. While Celerity concerns itself solely with being physically quick, Temporis tries to manipulate time itself to some scary extents. Your mentor urges caution and patience as it's very easy to end up stranded in the mists of history, or losing your own sense of time in the process if you act carelessly."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.180.a: "I am not afraid."

The earlier tests were rougher though, and you mind is fogged about what exactly happened during those events. Playing with the flow of time is one of the most disorientating powers a vampire can conjure after all."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.190.t: "Madhouse"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.190.desc: "Dementation is the signature discipline of clan Malkavian and is intrinsically linked to them. Some even think that Dementation is the cause of this clan's mental instability and can cause it to anyone trying to master its effects. As the blood containing this strange power starts entering your undead corpse, you are keenly aware of the possibility that this might have been a terrible mistake..."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.191.t: "In and Out"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.191.desc: "You have mastered the new power in your blood and are now able to use Dementation at your leisure.\nBut sometimes you have the feeling that it's Dementation that is using you and not the reverse.\nSince learning it, you have been plagued by visions and various other unstable bouts of prophetical frenzy. This has put a dent in your ability to actually rule your domain and you will likely need some time before fully controlling these new abilities."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.191.a: "So many things to share..."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.191.b: "You don't know anything!"

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.200.t: "The Voice"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.200.desc: "Named for the Greek Muse of Tragedy, Melpominee explores the power of the voice, shaking the very soul of those nearby and allowing the vampire to perform sonic feats otherwise impossible.\nThis peculiarity makes Melpominee much easier to work with for someone actually competent at singing. You will have to look for competent trainers able to help you master your voice before Melpominee's potential can be yours."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.201.desc: "You have been studying the intricacies of Melpominee during the last few nights and it has been going well. Still, your court has learned of this new hobby of yours and is now clamoring for a recital. This would be a good way to impress everyone as Melpominee reinforced performances are astounding, but it would likely also be quite stressful. You weren't expecting to be performing in front of an audience when starting this whole process really."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.210.t: "Animal Totem"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.210.desc: "Spiritus is a Discipline that allows the user to interacts with animalistic spirits. At its most basic levels it allows the vampire to speak with and summon spirits, but at higher levels power can be channeled from them to strengthen one self.\nLearning it often starts with a spiritual awakening, finally noticing all the spiritual residents living around the world and being able to learn from their insight and experience."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.210.a: "A spiritual awakening."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.211.t: "Spiritual Strength"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.211.desc: "While the early Spiritus practice concerned itself with noticing and learning from the spirits around you, the later exercises are more focused on how to best exploit this new knowledge. By devouring an animal spirit or summoning dead ones, the Spiritus' user can gain great, if temporary, benefits. It can make for a troubling experience after learning how to find and respect those same animal spirits though."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.220.desc: "At its most basic, Valeren provides control over pain and increased martial ability, seemingly allowing warriors to draw on the power of heaven to vanquish their foes.\nSpiritually though, it is deeply associated with the Warrior Caste of the Salubri and draw many of its rituals and practices from them. As such, any mentoring of Valeren requires discipline and a strict regimen that can really interferes with your duties as a ruler of the night."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.230.t: "On the Hunt"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.230.desc: "Primarily known for being an assassin's tool in the hands of the Banu Haqim Warrior caste, Quietus is the power over blood in its purest form. At its simplest (what you are trying to learn right now), it is a hunter's tool, allowing to transform your blood into poison or to silence an area before making your approach. Your mentor encourages you to hone these newfound skills with animal hunting, perhaps organizing a large scale hunt in the process as an exercise."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.230.a: "A solid idea."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.231.desc: "You have finished the early steps in mastering Quietus, adding a new tool to your arsenal. This is quite the feared tool however as this discipline is tied to assassins and other shadowy dealings in the dark.

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.240.desc: "A collection of powers attributed to the faeries and inclined toward the exposure of new knowledge, Mytherceria has driven many of its victims to babbling madness, or at least frustration.\nAs such, your mentor encourages caution in wanting to learn too much too quickly. But do you really have the time to spare?"

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.241.t: "Faerie Allure"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.241.desc: "Mytherceria draws deeply upon the powers of the Fae (real or otherwise) and the myths surrounding them. As a very rare discipline, it is also quite the subject of debate among your court now that you have finished your training. Some remark that you seem paler, almost translucent, while others discourse about you becoming a recluse yourself, perhaps drawn away by the new powers in your blood."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.242.t: "Magic is Learning"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.242.desc: "Sorcery, known to mages as linear magic or more dismissively as hedge magic or hedge wizardry, is the form of magic used by non-mages. Unlike true magic, one does not need to be Awakened (or Enlightened) to use sorcery. Thus, anyone with sufficient traits can become a sorcerer and use the linear paths of hedge magic. As a result, sorcery is the most common form of magic in the world. In contrast to psychic abilities, sorcery is not an innate ability and has to be learned.\nSlowly, painfully slowly, learned.\nYour teacher buried you in recommendations of books you will have to purchase, apparently all of them required to make progress into mastering this arcane art. No real choice but to dig in."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.243.t: "Learning is Magic"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.243.desc: "You have acquired the books needed to progress on your sorcerous adventure and you are confident that no true obstacle remains in your path to master the basics. New power is at your fingertips! ...and a lot of books to read as well.\nYou have quickly noticed that some of those reference other, more ancient, texts about sorcery. What you have right now is likely to be sufficient for your apprenticeship but you could go the extra mile and acquire those as well. It could be a good way to learn about some old and likely mostly forgotten knowledge."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.243.b: "No. More. Books."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.244.t: "The Magic of Faith"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.244.desc: "Theurgy is similar to Hedge Magic (also known as Sorcery), but the superstitions and sacrifices powering this [numina|E] follow the idioms of the Christian Church. Theurgists often invoke the name of the Archangel Raziel, “The Keeper of Secrets”, “The Angel of Mysteries”, who, it is written, stands close to the throne of God and put down all of the secrets of the universe into a book.\nAs a highly codified practice, only diligent learning is required to master its basics. You quickly find that the Christian trappings of it are quite strong however and make it harder to progress if you don't understand this religion well."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.244.a: "The Bible must have clues about it."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.245.t: "Shared Gospel"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.245.desc: "You have mastered the basics of Theurgy thanks to your hard work and you have noticed that Theurgy is actually quite a lot older than Christianity. Its roots stretch further back into Jewish mysticism and the teachings of Esoteric Christianity — to heighten one’s spiritual nature, to speak to one’s Higher Self, one’s Inner God, in order to better fathom the wisdom of God — to hear and to see and to speak the mysteries that the fleshy ear, jellied eye, and tongue of clay could not.\nThis has given you a fresh perspective on the interconnection between faiths and the many concepts they have in common."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.245.a: "The Divine is multifaceted."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.246.t: "Seeing Ghosts"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.246.desc: "A Lament is the method that a person uses to project their spirit into the realms of the dead. Laments are not tied into a character's personality as much as their state of mind. Those who have multiple near-death experiences or a sense of bravado or purpose are more likely to project than those who do not believe in ghosts or have never brushed against death.\nAs it is so closely tied to a person's core attributes, it is a difficult concept to teach. Many attempts often have to be made, and these can be painful experiences in their own right."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.246.a: "Let us get to it..."

There are many ways one can achieve such a feat, from skimmers, or those able to force their spirit from their body via meditation or drugs such as pigment to sleepers, or those who are frozen to the point of death, upon which they are kicked out of their bodies until they are revived, and everything in between.\nIf you make some more effort to exactly pinpoint your own preferred method of projecting, it could give you a head-start in progressing this new talent."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.248.t: "There is no Spoon"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.248.desc: "Psychics are people with the ability to perceive forces hidden from mundane senses through extrasensory perception, who may then use their minds to manipulate these supernatural elements. Some think they are manipulating the same powers as sorcerers do but rely on their mind instead of elaborate rituals. Psychic powers tend to be unreliable and fickle and its practitioners shunned by many.\nSome people are just born with unusual gifts or raw talent that leads to the discovery of these paranormal abilities, such as telepathy, telekinesis, and clairvoyance. The first step is thus to test to see if you possess this latent power or if more complex measures have to be taken."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.250.desc: "Demonology is the science of learning about demons, from their origin to the extent of their powers and length of their True Names. As such, it isn't technically infernalism, which is the act of summoning, binding or otherwise consorting with demons. But, let's be honest, the line between those two is very thin, and most people won't tell the difference.\nYou could take the slow approach of buying old books and artifacts from far and wide to learn at your own pace. Or you could take the easier road of just trying to ask about demonology from the source of it..."
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.250.a: "Everything can be found in books."

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.251.t: "The Horrible Truth"
 POD_mentoring_disciplines.251.desc: "Your foray into demonology taught you a great many things about demons and the origin of the world. It also opened your eyes on what seem to some ominous truths, like God turning his eyes away from Earth, leaving it to a slow descent into madness and despair. The picture in front of you is bleak to say the least, and challenges the way you were seeing the world until now.\nIt will take a steeled heart to continue on this path."

Originally taught by the Egyptian deity Osiris to his followers, it requires deep self meditation to even understand its concept.\nYour teacher can't help you much more than just giving you the core idea and offering several ways of reaching this state of inner peace.

 POD_mentoring_disciplines.253.desc: "Your meditation has proven successful enough in "centering your inner spirit" or so your teacher claims. In the times to come however you will not always have the luxury of finding your focus and you must thus learn to practice Bardo even during more difficult events.\nAnd that is why you are now practicing some ancient martial arts at the top of a mountain, somewhat unsure about the real utility of this exercise, but not wanting to upset your suddenly very strict teacher commenting on your form and each of your moves."

Your mentor is quite critical of the lack of stone constructions in your area and urges you to look at how this important material is used to make the greatest of architectural marvels.\nWhile a foreign concept to most vampires, to truly understand Visceratika, you must first understand the process of transforming a humble rock into the mightiest of castles."
