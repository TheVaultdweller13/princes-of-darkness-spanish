Unlike true magic, one does not need to be Awakened (or Enlightened) to use sorcery. Thus, anyone with sufficient traits can become a sorcerer and use the linear paths of hedge magic. As a result, sorcery is the most common form of magic in the world. In contrast to psychic abilities, sorcery is not an innate ability and has to be learned.\nSlowly, painfully slowly, learned.\nYour teacher buried you in recommendations of books you will have to purchase, apparently all of them required to make progress into mastering this arcane art.
