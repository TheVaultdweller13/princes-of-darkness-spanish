 POD_inquihunt.52.option.a: "I will be back."

 POD_inquihunt.53.t: "Your Bloody Mess"
 POD_inquihunt.53.desc: "Superior equipment, numbers and preparation weren't a match for raw savage strength it seems.\nEverywhere you look, you see one of your companions being brutally mauled by the giant claws of these monsters. Your own attacks seem to barely pierce their supernaturally strong hide and even the deepest of wounds only make them angrier and thus stronger.\nIt is over too quickly for you to even order a retreat with some of your men having already fled on their own. While the shapeshifters don't always give chase, you quickly notice that some of them, including your erstwhile target, have surrounded you, clearly understanding that you are the leader here.\nIt is time for the final battle it seems. As a hunter, you always knew it would end that way."
 POD_inquihunt.53.option.a: "I did what I could."

 POD_inquihunt.80.t: "Back to Hell"
 POD_inquihunt.80.desc: "Hunting demons poses a difficult conundrum due to the fact that they are truly immortal. Everything you know about them points to the fact that killing their corporeal form is merely a setback for them as they seem to be creatures of spiritual essence first and foremost.\nStill, hope is not lost as there are ways to at least make sure they are thrown back into the Hell where they belong. You are fairly confident that it's difficult for a demon to escape the Hells, probably needing the help of infernalists to do so.\nSo to hunt down a demon you need a good knowledge of their specific weakness, the means of isolating them from their probably numerous thralls ready to summon them back and a great deal of courage. You have the latter, time to work on the first two."
 POD_inquihunt.80.option.a: "I'm more than ready."
 POD_inquihunt.80.option.b: "I want to know everything there is about this demon."
 hunt_demon_abyss_tt: "This demon will lose their titles and be sent back to the Abyssal Prison."

 POD_inquihunt.81.t: "Exorcism 101"
 POD_inquihunt.81.desc: "Everything proceeded as planned. You gathered important intelligence on this demon, including part of their True Name, before working on their cult. Luckily, cultists tend to not be very smart (otherwise they wouldn't be cultists as far as you are concerned) so you managed to outwit them and send them on a doomed fool's errand.\nThe beauty of it is that you never had to confront the demon itself. Just find its spiritual anchor to this world, use the fragment of its True Name and perform an (arguably complex) exorcism on it to force their spirit out of their host. Once "freed", the pull of the Abyssal Prison did the rest of the work for you.\nA perfectly executed hunt."
 POD_inquihunt.81.option.a: "Free trip back to your jail."

 POD_inquihunt.82.t: "Hunter vs Demon"
 POD_inquihunt.82.desc: "Dealing with the demon's cultists was easy enough, some misdirection using their unholy zeal did the trick. The demon itself is another matter entirely. They have concealed everything regarding their True Name or their spiritual anchor to this world under so many layers of deceit that you have been misdirected yourself many times along the way.\nYou "think" you have a lead but you are being cautious now, following it could be one of the many traps left by your target to deal with threats just as yourself. If you were to spring it and reveal yourself to the demon, things would get rather... unpleasant. You wisely choose to drop the chase for now. You can always resume it later once hopefully the trail potentially leading up to you has gone cold."

 POD_inquihunt.83.t: "To Hell with You"
 POD_inquihunt.83.desc: "You were so certain that you had the right lead this time. After countless false intelligence and misleading information, you had finally gathered what you thought was a part of the True Name of the demon and the location of their spiritual anchor. Finally having something concrete to show for your efforts, you jumped into using that lead to start your exorcism... and fell right into a trap.\nAs the cultists are chanting in a circle around the altar you are chained to and the demon itself is promising you sweet torture, you are strangely mainly wondering if Hell indeed exists. You have the unpleasant feeling that you will find out very soon."
 POD_inquihunt.83.option.a: "The final one way trip."

 POD_inquihunt.110.t: "Dream Hunter"
 POD_inquihunt.110.desc: "There are many tales surrounding the mysterious Fae folk... which actually doesn't help at all in hunting them as most of them are contradictory. Piercing the layer of intentional deceit around these beings isn't easy but you managed to wrangle one important fact: cold iron can kill them.\nNow, just walking into one of their "courts" would be akin to a death sentence. Fae are known master tricksters hiding behind layer upon layer of illusions. But they have a weakness in their interest for humankind. If you make yourself interesting enough, perhaps you could get invited and get close enough to your target to strike..."
 POD_inquihunt.110.option.a: "I have to dream big."
 POD_inquihunt.110.option.b: "I want the best cold iron dagger gold can buy."

 POD_inquihunt.111.t: "The End of a Dream"
 POD_inquihunt.111.desc: "It took some preparation but you managed to make yourself look interesting enough to draw the attention of the local faeries. Playing your part as the clueless mortal entranced by the whimsical creatures, you followed them into their strange world of wonders. Managing to keep your wits about you despite the ambient chaos, you caught the eye of your target who muttered something about extracting the "glamour" out of you.\nOnce secluded, and before they could do whatever they planned to, your cold iron dagger sliced their throat. You were gone from the fae court minutes later with none the wiser."
 POD_inquihunt.111.option.a: "Back to reality."

 POD_inquihunt.112.t: "Dreamless Nights"
 POD_inquihunt.112.desc: "Despite your best efforts to make yourself appear attractive to the strange Fae, you have hit a dead end. Perhaps you didn't completely understand what it is they are looking for in a mortal or perhaps they simply understood your true intent.\nWhatever the case, the Fae court, and your target, stays stubbornly closed to you. With them likely aware of your intent now, barging in would be a very bad idea. You will have to wait for another opportunity."

 POD_inquihunt.113.t: "Dream to Nightmare"
 POD_inquihunt.113.desc: "You first noticed something went wrong in the Fae court itself. Before that, you thought your act to appear interesting enough to attract your target's attention was working perfectly. It's when they all started crowding around you and that the surroundings took a much darker tone that you understood the big mistake you have made.\nYou don't know how or when but it is quite certain that they noticed that you brought cold iron, a grave anathema, to their home. It is also quite certain that your last nightmare is only beginning."
