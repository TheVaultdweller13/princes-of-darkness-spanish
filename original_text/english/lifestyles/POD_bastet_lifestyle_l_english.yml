Now she remembers the service by gifting certain cat-folk with a profound fertility, which they may bestow upon others if they wish. Although the Gift doesn’t insure that a given mating will sire a Bastet kitten, many within the Folk claim that without the Blessing, their kind might be virtually extinct. #!"

 TRAVELERS_TONGUES_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor By flexing Rahjah's powers, a Bastet can translate any human language in her vicinity. Invoking the Unmaker will turn everything into gibberish.#!" 
 PART_THE_CURTAIN_PERK_EFFECT: "[umbra_aptitude|E]: [grace_i]#P +50%#! \n #flavor Like the Level Four Common Gift: Walking Between Worlds, this spell allows a leopard to cross into the Near Umbra. This variation, however, lets her bring others across as well.#!"

 COBRAS_DANCE_PERK_EFFECT: "More likely to [imprison|E] [characters|E] after a successful [siege|E] or [raid|E].\n #flavor Long ago, a panther named Tola entered into negotiations with King Snake.

The Dance allows a cat to freeze prey with a glance. #!"

 ALMS_TO_THE_POOR_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor The werecat may summon up a small bit of money or food, generally to give to a beggar. If the cat uses the "alms" for himself, he's left with a bitter taste in his mouth and greasy palms.#!"
 SCHOLARS_FRIEND_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor The Bubasti may read any scroll, tablet or book placed in front of him, no matter what language it's in. Coded messages remain written in code. #!"
 BANISH_CAHLASHS_BROOD_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor By calling upon the Father of Dark Spirits, a Bubasti may command Wyrmish spirits to depart. Each time the Bubasti does so, his fur grows a deeper shade of black and his actions become more… erratic. Sense Wyrm detects a faint trace of Wyrm-taint on the Bastet for a week afterward. #!"
 THE_MANY_TONGUES_OF_PTAH_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor This Gift allows Gaia’s warriors to read and wield the spirit of speech, bypassing the need to learn different languages and dialects.#!"
 THE_SCARABS_FLIGHT_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor By calling together the elements of her soul, a Bubasti can send them out of her body for a while. The body itself enters a deathlike trance until the Scarab returns; although it doesn’t decompose, all other signs (magical and otherwise) declare that the cat has died. The flying Scarab resembles an ordinary insect unless inspected with magical senses, in which case it glows brightly.#!"
 SHADOW_BRETHREN_PERK_EFFECT: "As a [character_interaction|E], allows you to create a clone of yourself.\n #flavor The Bubasti summons up shadowy duplicates of himself to stand by him in battle. These shadow-cats resemble the Bubasti and have some of the same capabilities. A night-spirit teaches this Gift.#!"
 SPIRIT_WALL_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor One of the greatest tricks a Bubasti learns is the art of calling together minor spirits from around the area and forming them into a wailing Umbral wall. Such magics do not endear a cat to the spirits in general, but by the time she achieves this Rank, a Bubasti should have enough sense to use such power wisely — and enough power to protect herself when she uses it at all.#!"
 MOUSEMAZE_PERK_EFFECT: "Give [GetModifier('mousemaze_perk_modifier').GetNameWithTooltip] [modifier|E] to enemy [knights|E] when acting as a [commander|E] during the [combat_phase|E], or to your foe during [single_combat_duel_plural|E].\n #flavor An unsettling spell of confusion, this Gift disorients a target until he blunders around in a panic. Walls shift and close in, shadows lengthen, sounds drift to his ears from all corners, and familiar places seem strange and threatening. Although the magic has no real effect on the person’s surroundings, his terror and confusion send him into a frenzy, making him an easy target for the werecat lurking nearby.#!"
 THE_FLEEING_SCARAB_PERK_EFFECT: "Allows resurrection if you die from unnatural causes.\n#F One of the Bubasti's most obscure tribal secrets, this Gift allows a cat to remove her soul, incarnate it, and send it out of harm's way while her body dies. The soul, which often takes the form of a flying scarab beetle, searches out an appropriate new host body, climbs into its mouth while it sleeps, and "lays" the old soul into the new host. The Bubasti who knows this forbidden secret (and less than eight such cats exist) is theoretically immortal, though such longevity is purchased in other beings' lives.#!"

 THOUSAND_THUNDER_STRIKE_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor By slamming his paws together and invoking Rahjah or one of his manifestations (Shiva, Pan Gu, etc.), an angry tiger causes a shockwave that can level buildings or disrupt unclean spirits.

 SHADOW_THE_MOONS_LIGHT_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor There is a time for everything, even for stealth. As nocturnal hunters, the catkings have perfected a secret which allows them to dim the light as they approach.

 ROYAL_PRIVILEGE_PERK_EFFECT: "Allow picking another breed and tribe gifts lifestyle without the corresponding breed [trait|E] or [faith|E].\n#F This deeply despised trickery allows an ancient and powerful lion to steal another werecat's Gifts, even those which traditionally belong only to that tribe or breed.

 DANCE_OF_THE_CHAYA_PERK_EFFECT: "Unlock $seek_aid_of_the_spirits_decision$ [decision|E]. \n #flavor One of the greatest favors a Bastet can offer a spirit is the chance to ride in his skin for a while. Although most cats would never consider such a “loan,” many Swara see voluntary possession as a service, not a chore. This Gift, which begins with a frenzied dance, allows a chaya to enter the werecat and “take control” for a while. The spirit gets a body to ride, and the werecat gets certain… benefits. The Dance is seen more as an act of love or affection than of servitude — a sentiment few Bastet would ever understand. #!"
