 ENTROPIC_TOUCH_PERK_EFFECT: "#F With a touch, the character can temporarily weaken the physical structure of an object, or even of a living being.#!"
 EXTENSIBLE_LIMB_PERK_EFFECT: "#F One or more of the character's limbs — arms, legs, tails, even tongues — can stretch out to manipulate objects or strike an opponent at range.

 EYES_OF_THE_WYRM_PERK_EFFECT: "#F The fomor's eyes are somehow unusual. They may be compound eyes like an insect's, or possess strangely shifting pupils and irises, or even swim with ripples of iridescent, unclean color. Those who meet the fomor's gaze see a more dreadful pattern hidden within — glimpses of the maddening damnation of the Wyrm.#!"
 FLIGHT_PERK_STATS_EFFECT: "#F The character is able to fly, either through wings (of any description) or some other form of propulsion (such as wind-riding for a storm-aspected Kami). She may hover, glide, soar or dive, as the player chooses.#!"

The attack need not actually be a breath weapon; any sort of long-range attack will do.#!"
 HEART_SENSE_PERK_EFFECT: "#F The Kami can see into the very heart of an individual, determining her general spiritual allegiance (Wyrm, Wyld, Weaver, Gaia or other), her innocence or guilt, her true form (if she is wearing another shape), even her most secret dreams and desires or her connections to the past.#!"
 HOMOGENEITY_PERK_EFFECT: "As a [character_interaction|E], allows you to remove a target's [battle_modifier|E].\n#F The character can counteract all supernatural powers within five yards of her, or focus on one opponent and prevent him from using such powers for considerably longer. Homogeneity does not work on "innate" powers; therefore, while it will counteract a Garou's Gifts, it will not stop them from shapeshifting.#!"
 HORROR_PERK_EFFECT: "Give [GetModifier('POD_delirium_modifier').GetNameWithTooltip] [modifier|E] to enemy [knights|E] when acting as a [commander|E] during the [combat_phase|E], or to your foe during [single_combat_duel_plural|E].\nYou can bypass delirium immunity.\n#F The character's presence is so disturbing that it evokes the same supernatural panic in mortals as witnessing a Garou in Crinos form. More powerful characters can even inflict terror and disbelief on the supernatural. This power almost always manifests in characters with truly bestial, animalistic or outright monstrous forms.#!"
 IMMUNITY_TO_THE_DELIRIUM_PERK_EFFECT: "You won't gain [GetModifier('POD_delirium_modifier').GetNameWithTooltip] modifier when fighting with shapeshifters in war or [single_combat_duel|E] anymore.\n#F The character is not subject to any of the Delirium's effects.#!"
 INFECTIOUS_BITE_TOUCH_PERK_EFFECT: "As a [character_interaction|E], allows you to give diseases.\n#F The character is able to spread a vicious infection by bite or touch. If the host manages to infect at arget, the target becomes feverish and sickly, and will be mildly contagious until the infection heals.#!"
 INVISIBILITY_PERK_STATS_EFFECT: "Unlock [GetModifier( 'POD_shapeshift_form_invisible_modifier' ).GetNameWithTooltip|L] shapeshift option.\n#F The character disappears from sight. She leaves no footprints, but still makes noise and still gives off scent, and will still register to Gifts such as Sense Wyrm (if applicable).#!"

The liquid-form character can flow through small openings without difficulty, although it has difficulty moving uphill.#!"
 LONGEVITY_PERK_EFFECT: "#F The Kami's lifespan is extended by a factor often; a human-host Kami would live for around 700 years with the assistance of this power. If the Kami purchases this power five times, he is effectively ageless.#!"

 MATTER_WEAVE_PERK_EFFECT: "#F The character is capable of reshaping matter into new forms and functions. Drones commonly use this power to repair damage to structures or patch up imperfections; gorgons use it almost at their whim, remolding objects into bizarre new configurations to weaken the Weaver's hold on an area.#!"
 MEMORY_CARESS_PERK_EFFECT: "#F The character's spirit half interferes with the minds of ordinary people in order to keep the character's activities secret. On lookers react to the character in whatever way they normally would, but their memories of the character fade once the character has left. This power certainly has its drawbacks — it's hard to hold down a day job if your boss forgets you exist whenever you leave the room — but for many possessed, anonymity is the ultimate defense.#!"
 MIND_BLAST_PERK_EFFECT: "You are able to [imprison|E] [characters|E] that would have been impossible to capture in [siege|E] or [raid|E] otherwise.\nWay more likely to [imprison|E] [characters|E] after a successful [siege|E] or [raid|E].\n#F The character can immobilize a target with a bolt of psychic energy. The victim collapses to the ground, writhing in pain, at the mercy of his assailant.#!"
 FOMORI_MIND_RAPE_PERK_EFFECT: "As a [character_interaction|E], allows you to know every secret and scheme of the target.\n#F The fomor may invade a target's mind and forcibly wrench information from it. While this does no actual damage, the victim tends to feel naked and violated for several days afterwards (and often has a splitting headache to boot).#!"
 NATURAL_WEAPONRY_PERK_EFFECT: "Unlock Natural Weaponry Shapeshift option.\n#F The character manifests natural weaponry in the form of claws, fangs, horns, or just sharp bony protrusions.#!"
 NIGHTMARE_COMMAND_PERK_EFFECT: "Unlocks [GetScheme('PODsoul_bridge').GetTypeName] [scheme|E].\n#F The fomor may cause a target to suffer from horrifying nightmares, depriving the victim of restful sleep. The fomor may choose to influence the content of the dreams, or simply let the victim's subconscious do the dirty work.#!"
 PEACEFUL_FIGHTING_PERK_EFFECT: "More likely to [imprison|E] [characters|E] after a successful [siege|E] or [raid|E].\n#F The character is able to fight with her full strength without permanently damaging her opponents. Kami use this power out of mercy; Drones out of a desire to avoid any major disruptions.#!"
 PIERCING_GAZE_PERK_EFFECT: "#F The Kami is able to make anyone it looks at feel uncomfort-able and ill at ease, as if the Kami is staring directly into her soul. This power is usually used to drive away trespassers, although it can serve as an excellent aid to interrogation.#!"
 PLANT_ANIMATION_PERK_EFFECT: "Can recruit [GetMaA('animated_tree').GetName] as [men_at_arms|E]\n#F The character is able to animate plants, causing trees, vines, shrubs and the like to move in ways normally denied them.

 PLIANT_BONES_PERK_EFFECT: "Increase the chance of success for the Escape from Prison [decision|E].\n#F The character's bones can become soft and malleable, allowing her to squeeze through small openings like a rat. The character can also wriggle free of bonds and restraints, given time.#!"

 POISON_TUMORS_PERK_EFFECT: "Unlock [GetModifier( 'POD_shapeshift_form_poison_tumors_modifier' ).GetNameWithTooltip|L] shapeshift option.\n#F The fomor's body is covered with odd tumors filled with caustic pus, usually of some repugnant color and smell.#!"
 REASSURING_PRESENCE_PERK_EFFECT: "#F The character may change his appearance to match whatever person the greatest number of onlookers at any given time would respect and listen to. Although this power may seem weak, a clever fomor or Drone can use it to go almost anywhere and obtain limited cooperation from almost anyone.#!"
 REGENERATION_PERK_STATS_EFFECT: "Remove all wounds and maims every three months.\n#F The character regenerates damage almost immediately, in the same manner as a werewolf.#!"

 SEASONS_BLESSINGS_PERK_EFFECT: "#F The Kami can bring the effects of a particular season to an area: leaves may fall from trees if Autumn's Blessings are invoked, while a Kami attuned to winter may call a snowfall.#!"
 SELF_IMMOLATION_PERK_EFFECT: "Unlock [GetModifier( 'POD_shapeshift_form_fire_modifier' ).GetNameWithTooltip|L] shapeshift option.\n#F The character can immolate herself, becoming a walking bonfire.

 SHADOWPLAY_PERK_EFFECT: "Unlock [GetModifier( 'POD_shapeshift_form_shadow_modifier' ).GetNameWithTooltip|L] shapeshift option.\n#F The character can manipulate local shadows, drawing them together into an area of darkness. The character can always see in his own shadows.#!"
 SILENT_SPEECH_PERK_EFFECT: "#F The character is able to communicate without speech, speaking to individuals mind-to-mind. This power bypasses all language barriers, although the character cannot communicate in this fashion with creatures without language unless using another power to do so.#!"
 SIZE_PERK_EFFECT: "As a [character_interaction|E], allows you to become [GetTrait('giant').GetName( GetPlayer )] or [GetTrait('dwarf').GetName( GetPlayer )].\n#F While the [GetPerk('fomori_bulky_perk').GetName( GetPlayer )] power represents a particularly massive specimen of the host body type, this represents dramatic and permanent shifts in a character's size.#!"
 SKINCHANGER_KINSHIP_PERK_EFFECT: "#F This power represents a great spiritual connection to and friendship with one of the Changing Breeds. The most common version of this power is Garou Kinship (since the other Breeds have fallen into decline), but a Kami may possess Kinship to any shapechanger race, even Ratkin or Ananasi.#!"
 SKINSHIFT_PERK_EFFECT: "Bonus to Shapeshift [character_interaction|E] to change appearance.\n#F The possessed character may alter the appearance of his flesh, quickly and fluidly taking on the features and body shape of an entirely different creature within moments.#!"

 SPIRIT_RENDING_PERK_EFFECT: "You can imprison, torture, execute or physically hurt spirits during [single_combat_duel_plural|E].\n#F Fomori with this power can use their Rage to strikeout against spirits across the Gauntlet and feed on their energies. Of course, a fomor who misjudges her quarry might be in for a fatal surprise.#!"
 SPIRIT_SENSE_PERK_EFFECT: "Unlock $seek_aid_of_the_spirits_decision$ [decision|E].\n#F The character is able to see across the Gauntlet, watching the occurrences in the local Penumbra.#!"

 SUCCUBUS_VEIL_PERK_EFFECT: "Unlock [GetScheme('PODenthrall').GetTypeName] [scheme|E].\n#F The character can appear as a target's ideal mate, and with a gesture, beckon him to her side. Successful use of this power indicates that the target is so completely enthralled by the character that he will do anything reasonable to please her. Alternately, the character may activate this power to entrance anyone who lays eyes on her, although this “blanket entrancement” is much less potent.#!"
 TAINT_SUPPRESSION_PERK_EFFECT: "#F The fomor can briefly negate the effects of any of his Taints. Suppressed physical deformities heal back to unmarred flesh in seconds; derangements vanish in a burst of perfect clarity, etc.#!"
 TAR_BABY_PERK_EFFECT: "Bonus chance to maim an enemy [knights|E] when in [combat_phase|E] as a [knight|E].\n#F The character's skin or "flesh" is made of a thick, sticky substance like molasses or tar.

 VEIL_BREACH_PERK_EFFECT: "#F Characters with this Power can reach into a human's mind and tear out the slivers of consciousness susceptible to the Delirium.

 VOICE_OF_REASON_PERK_EFFECT: "#F The character's voice becomes a strange, seductive monotone, lulling listeners into a state of hypnotic calm.#!"
 VOICE_OF_THE_WYRMCH_PERK_EFFECT: "#F The fomor's tongue has been altered into a strange form:possibly thick and slug-like, possibly long and forked, possibly even transmuted into a mass of tendrils. The fomor may speak as normal, and may also speak in the Wyrm's own language.#!"

 WEBBING_PERK_EFFECT: "Your prisoner has less chance of escaping from your prison.\n#F Allows for the creation of webs to bind fallen foes, seal off openings or even lower oneself from a great height. The power may take many forms according to the character.

 ANIMATE_SELF_PERK_EFFECT: "#F Gorgons and Kami bound into inanimate objects such as trees or statues may take this power, which allows them to animate their host body. Without this power, a character with a plant or mineral host is immobile.#!"

 CORRUPTED_VISIONS_PERK_EFFECT: "#F "I had to do it! God told me to!" By utilizing this gift of corruption, a fomor induces hallucinations in some helpless victim. Voices from God, fleeting glimpses of something just out of sight, scoldings, mockery and other paranoiac favorites are only a few of the possibilities. Although this Power works best when the fomor looks normal enough to pass for human, an especially deformed one can use it while hiding. Knowing your victim helps when using Corrupted Visions; a rational person would be suspicious if Jesus suddenly told her to go on a killing spree, while someone who was already disturbed might think it was a perfectly good idea. Of course, a seemingly-rational person could be driven crazy by subtle, well-chosen visions. After that, anything goes...#!"
 DARKSIGHT_PERK_STATS_EFFECT: "#F The character is capable of seeing in the dark just as well as he might in daylight.#!"
 DECEPTION_PERK_EFFECT: "[GetTrait('diablerist').GetName( GetPlayer )] trait will be auto-hided upon exposure\nAllow friendly interactions with gaian werewolf as Wyrm-tainted.\n#F The fomor can hide the spiritual evidence of his Wyrm taint from others. The Gift: Sense Wyrm will nor detect the fomor as Wyrm-tainted. The fomor can also use this Power on others, to cover their stain. For instance, the fomor can hide the evidence of a vampire's diablerie or even change a normal Garou's aura so that she appears to be Wyrm-tainted when in fact she is not. Fomori under the influence of this Power are also immune to mummies' Hekau (True Name) spells.#!"
 ECTOPLASMIC_EXTRUSION_PERK_EFFECT: "#F The character is able to generate up to four semi-solid tentacles or arms that can stretch out up to five yards, manipulating objects or even striking blows.

 ELEMENTAL_RESISTANCE_PERK_EFFECT: "#F The host's resistance to a certain type of energy form is augmented to supernatural degrees. The chosen source can be mundane, such as fire or lightning, or may even come from more mystical sources such as balefire.#!"
 ENHANCED_ATTRIBUTE_PERK_EFFECT: "#F The host's natural capabilities are magnified to superhuman levels. This power isn't restricted to Physical Attributes — a Wyld-possessed being might boast Enhanced Wits, while a fomor might well develop unearthly Appearance, the better to lure victims.#!"
 ENHANCEMENT_PERK_EFFECT: "#F The fomor can become any living creature's ideal mate, by scanning their target's mind.#!"
 EXOSKELETON_PERK_EFFECT: "#F The fomor has a hard cara-pace-like growth all over her body. It is usually very bonelike, with many gnarls, veinlike tubes and odd shapes upon it. Its coloration ranges from a rusty red and dark brown to oily black.#!"

The fumes look and smelllike cigarette smoke. In addition, the gas weakens the lung tissue of those who breath it. Repeated exposure to the noxious breath over several weeks or months leads to the development of lung cancer in victims.#!"
 NUMBING_PERK_EFFECT: "#F The fomor's body can become completely numb. She feels no pain. However, she is numb to all sensation. She cannot talk properly (her tongue feels permanently anesthetized) and she may cut herself and feel nothing, which may result in infected or gangrenous wounds the fomor is unaware of.#!"
 PROCREATION_PERK_EFFECT: "#F The fomor can transmit a Bane through blood and semen-any encounter involving bodily fluids can spread the Bane. The Bane will then attempt to possess the recipient of the fluids. The fomor may only pass on a Bane similar to that which possessed him.#!"
 PROLONGED_LIFE_PERK_EFFECT: "#F The fomor's natural lifespan is greatly prolonged. This is not true immortality, since the fomor will die of natural causes eventually (natural death amongst fomori is practically unknown).#!"

 SAVAGE_GENITALIA_PERK_EFFECT: "#F John Bobbit's nightmare; the fomor (regardless of gender) has genitals with some menacing feature Male variations include excessive length (14''+) or hardness, thorns, sandpaper texture or curved barbs; female versions are infamous for teeth, ripping suction and internal meat grinders. This is obviously no good in combat, but devastating in bed.#!"
 SENSE_THE_UNNATURAL_PERK_EFFECT: "#F Similar to the Garou Gift of the same name, this Power allows the fomor to smell any supernatural being present, such as vampires, werewolves, mages, wraiths and other spirits.#!"
 SKITTERSIGHT_PERK_EFFECT: "#F This weird Power allows the fomor to pull out her eyes, twist the optic nerves into feet, and send the eyes scurrying down hallways and around corners in order to see things normally obscured. She'll have to be careful --if the eyes get squashed, she'll be forever blinded.#!"
 SLITHER_SKIN_PERK_EFFECT: "#F The skin of the fomor is a weapon and a useful helper. The fomor can shed her skin, giving it certain simple instructions (no more than fivewords). The skin detaches at the rectum and peels off over the fomor's head. It can walk, grab things or attack.#!"
 SLOBBER_SNOT_PERK_EFFECT: "#F The fomor's skin is covered with small warts which excrete an extremely slick and runny slime. This slime renders the fomor's body virtually frictionless, making it almost impossible for opponents to grasp the fomor. The slimy gel also helps the fomor to squeeze through tight spaces. Slobber Snot dissolves almost instantly in direct sun light.#!"
 STOMACH_PUMPER_PERK_EFFECT: "#F The fomor is able to vomit forth all he has recently eaten covered in acidic slimy stomach juices.#!"
 TOXIC_SECRETIONS_PERK_EFFECT: "#F This Power turns the fomor's bodily fluids into toxic waste.#!"
