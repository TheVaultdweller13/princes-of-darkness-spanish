 nick_of_tronje:0 "of Tronje"
 nick_of_tronje_desc:0 "'Tronje' could also be the Colonia Ulpia Traiana, a Roman city close to modern Xanten, and the area from which Siegfreid came. This would explain Hagen's seemingly profound knowledge of incidents and deeds from Siegfreid's youth. Similarly, the name of the small village of Castle Dhronecken in the Hunsrück Mountains sounds like 'Tronje'; in the Middle Ages its name was 'Troneck' and it lay in the historic Kingdom of the Burgundians. Not too far away, there are place names that hint at further figures from the Nibelungenlied, especially Hagen's relative Ortwin of Metz and his colleagues Hunold and Volker von Alzey. Based on the castles around Dhronecken, Ortwin can be assigned to Metz, Hagen to Dhronecken, Hunold to Hunoldispetra (now Hunolstein in Morbach), and Volker to Alzey. These are places that travelers would pass on the way from Xanten via Metz and Worms to Passau."
