If a mage fills the cauldron with rocks, a stone elemental will emerge to fight for him. Likewise, filling the Cauldron of Gruffydd with daggers and clay will result in a horrible (and deadly) servitor something like a barbed golem. Obviously, certain combinations are more effective than others, but even an army of willow branch soldiers is better than no army at all."

The charm used to create these treasures is simple, and the needles work just as well on leather, silk or skin.

 artifact_rooting_amulet_description:0 "This treasure was originally created by a wood inanimae to punish a queen who violated an oath and entered his grove. The fae crafted a beautiful amulet and gave it to one of the queen's courtesans as a gift for his mistress. The queen loved the intricately woven silver necklace and clasped it around her neck. When next she placed a foot on the ground outside her home, her legs rooted themselves into the soil and her body and arms became the trunk and branches of a tree. Revealing himself as a faerie of the wood, the inanimae reclaimed the amulet and spoke words of warning to the queen's court about venturing too far into the nearby woods."

 artifact_shatterhammer_name:0 "Shatterhammer"
 artifact_shatterhammer_description:0 "These formidable weapons were crafted during the height of the War of Seasons, and precious few are known to exist today. Sprites born of earthquakes or landslides are most often oathbound into these treasures, or even cursed rock or dirt inanimae.

Such hammers have been known to shatter armor and bones, rupture internal organs, splinter large oaken doors, and even bring down stone towers."

The eye has been dormant for centuries, however, but with the coming of the Red Star visible in the [dreaming|E] that the fae call the Eye of Balor, the Royal Guardians have bathed the eye in its light in a protected spot.

Those caught in the mist experience terror in their hearts and even the bravest knights and honorable opponents flee in a panic, often dropping their weapons or anything else they are carrying in their haste to get away. The drawback is that if the wind changes, the ones using the cauldron could be caught in the backlash."

Useful for explorers and wanderers in need of "any port in a storm," the compass doesn't distinguish between the hold of a Seelie motley and that of an Unseelie commoner-hating lord. Since some freeholders keep their homes hidden, they may not look too kindly on the owner of this treasure."

A skilled Dreamcrafter can create chimerical creatures of immense power, fold the Dreaming in on itself to create pocket realms, or build a trod or gateway where there was none before.

 artifact_basilisk_stone_description:0 "Unfortunately, most people don't appreciate Nocker speech habits and while the nockers may rail against such harsh judgements, even they understand there are times when they need to shut up and that can be difficult to do. A Basilisk Stone is, therefore, invaluable while at court or when trying to hold down a job in the mundane world. Although Blistertongue Jill shattered the first and greatest of these treasures, the shards of the original still hold some of Byzamedas' old magic."

So long as the pooka remembers to leave one at home and doesn’t lose the one they're carrying, they can eventually sniff their way back. Obviously, they could also be shared between friends so the pooka could find the other person in case they were separated. "

For a year and a day, every set of boots that the shoemaker created had the special quality that they made other people ignore the wearer’s presence.

 artifact_balthazars_bracelets_description:0 "If nothing else, these matching bracelets have a delicate beauty that makes them a special addition to the stash of any pooka who likes pretty, shiny things. However, they also have a very unique benefit when worn. When placed on the wrists, they tighten of their own accord to fit smoothly over the changeling’s forearms, swirling up from wrist to elbow. If the faerie knocks once on the bracelets, they meld to the skin and become ebony tattoos that will shape-shift with the pooka when he changes to his animal mien. In that form, the tattoos simply resemble markings on the animal’s skin."
 artifact_cleopatras_wings_name:0 "Cleopatra's Wings"
 artifact_cleopatras_wings_description:0 "This handsome, one-of-a-kind choker has a butterfly pendant hanging from a wide gold band that fits around the neck. Made of amber, the butterfly’s wings blush scarlet near the golden body and lighten to a warm orange near the tips. The changeling that wears the necklace gains the ability to fly in a manner similar to that of the Wind Runner cantrip. A pair of shimmery, intangible wings appear at the faerie’s back. The wings themselves have no substance and cannot be damaged. They disappear as soon as the changeling removes the choker."
 artifact_osiris_flail_name:0 "Osiris' Flail"
 artifact_osiris_flail_description:0 "The first pharaoh of ancient Egypt, Osiris, kept two symbols of power. One of these, his flail, is depicted on the sarcophagi of many of the pharaohs that followed in his footsteps. It is usually shown crossed with a crook over the chest of the dead king. The flail is a short-handled rod from which hangs a group of three leather strips decorated with wooden beads and bone. Reportedly, it recorded all of history in the chimerical carvings upon its bone and wood beads. To tap its extensive wisdom, a person simply asked a question, then touched the flail to her brow. The answer came immediately."
 artifact_gauntlets_name:0 "Gauntlets"
 artifact_gauntlets_description:0 "Gauntlets are, on the simplest level, a pair of gloves. If that were all they were, however, redcaps wouldn't be quite so fond of them. However, each redcap who makes himself a pair of gauntlets makes sure to stud them with fishhooks, razor blades, broken glass, rusty nails and splinters. No two pairs of gauntlets are alike, and most redcaps swear they can't wear any but their own."
 artifact_dry_dust_name:0 "Dry Dust"
 artifact_dry_dust_description:0 "What dry dust does is simple. It makes whoever ingests it (though it always must be ingested in conjunction with food or drink, never by itself) ravenously hungry and unquenchably thirsty for a period of an hour. During that time, the victim will attempt to eat anything — and in some cases anyone — he can get his hands on. Dry dust has a variety of uses, ranging from assisting in poisonings to crude practical jokes. Only redcaps seem to know the secret of its manufacture, and the few who have been questioned about it hint darkly at having ground up human bone to make the stuff. They may be telling the truth, or they may just be trying to make their interviewers uncomfortable. Either way, it speaks volumes."
 artifact_blooded_gauntlets_name:0 "Blooded Gauntlets"
 artifact_blooded_gauntlets_description:0 "Whereas the spikes, protrusions, blades and hooks of a regular pair of gauntlets are merely sharp and dangerous, the ones on a pair of Blooded Gauntlets are actively hungry. When they tear into an opponent, they want to stay there, and they'll do as much damage as they can. Witnesses (and the very occasional survivor) swear that the blades and whatnot actually move to rend the flesh of a target once a punch connects. The hooks snag the Blooded Gauntlet in place while the rest of the equipment goes to work, ripping its way down to bone and beyond. The poor fool who takes a stomach punch from a redcap wearing these is doomed to a few very brief moments of agony, and nothing more."
 artifact_grinder_name:0 "The Grinder"
 artifact_grinder_description:0 "It cannot be stressed enough that the Grinder can swallow just about anything. Metal? No problem. Dead bodies? Easy as pie. An elephant? It might take a while, but down it goes. And no matter what goes it, the same filling-but-not-very-tasty paste comes out. Of course, the size of the object being tossed in and the raw materials it's made from impact how long it takes for the Grinder to chew it up once and for all, but in the end, if the redcap with the crank is willing to work at it, the device can dispose of pretty much anything imaginable."

 artifact_winterblade_description:0 "Some say that winter blade is the scythe that will cut away the Summer of the world and plunge all into Winter. It will chill the earth where it touches and render permanently sterile any ground it rests on. A single nick from its blade is enough to wither a tree of centuries' growth, and the merest scratch will drain the life from a victim.

He and Dionysus developed a friendship and after Hera's second attempt on Dionysus' life, Hermes gave him the horn."
 artifact_halcyon_halter_name:0 "Halcyon Halter"
 artifact_halcyon_halter_description:0 "The halcyon was a bird, identified with the kingfisher, that had the ability to soothe the winds and waves when it nested upon the sea during the winter solstice. The bird's legend originated in Greece where sailors threw sweet biscuits into the Mediterranean Sea to draw it and then, in the calmer seas, near their ports. Decorated with the bird's feathers, this halter makes an X across the chest of its wearer, crossing right over the heart where the brightest feathers stand out."
 artifact_minoan_mosaic_name:0 "Minoan Mosaic"
 artifact_minoan_mosaic_description:0 "The ancient art of mosaics was developed in ancient Greece. It involves setting pieces of colored tile in mortar to form a picture or decorative design. The Minoan Mosaic originated on Crete during the reign of King Minos. According to legend, this treasure shows the image of a faceless person until a changeling gazes into it for an extended period of time. Spending one point of Glamour, the faerie begins to see the face of their one true love appearing amidst the tiles. Narcissus peered into the Minoan Mosaic and was disappointed when the only image he found there was his own. He proclaimed the Mosaic to be a fake. He was apparently proven wrong."

 artifact_syrinx_description:0 "The one and only Syrinx was the first pipe made. Many Kithain have heard of this treasure and fear its appearance because it has the ability to inspire incredible passion in those who hear its song. Because it was born of true love, though, it doesn't trigger generic passions as the Gift of Pan does. Instead it makes those who mourn lost love feel the bittersweet pain more acutely and it urges those who do love to act on their emotions with the target of their affection. The music intensifies all of these feelings and solidifies them forevermore. The one who loves, when they hear the music of Syrinx, will love that person forever and maybe beyond."
 artifact_inner_spinners_name:0 "Inner Spinners"
 artifact_inner_spinners_description:0 "Creepy, crawly, dark, and dank, the Inner Spinners are instruments of revenge and torture. In essence they are tiny, chimerical arachnids done up in black lacquer and clockwork. When placed in the house or sleeping quarters of their intended victim, they go to work. Once the target is safely dozing, the Spinners scuttle over them and proceed to crawl into their ears, nose, and nostrils. There they spin chimerical webs so thick and sticky that the target may suffocate, choke, or go temporarily deaf."

 artifact_gloves_of_night_description:0 "While the underfolk can twist their bodies to fit into nearly any crevice or opening, there are times when even the most flexible will find themself stopped by a locked door. For those moments, the Gloves of Night come in handy. By spending a point of Glamour, the flesh within the Gloves can be liquified or solidified at the whim of the wearer. This allows the crawler wearing them to remodel their digits into claws, suction cups, or even lock-picks. The user can also choose the consistency of the mutated fingers, allowing enough rigidity for a fleshy lock-pick to turn tumblers without lacerations."

 artifact_wordspider_description:0 "A chimerical, mechanical, methodical breaker of codes and discoverer of secrets.

 artifact_brooch_of_the_true_suitor_description:0 "These are simple metal brooches that draw no attention to themselves save for the simplicity and quality of their craftsmanship. To those who know their powers, however, they are invaluable aids in the pursuit of true love. Should a true suitor wear one while confronting the object of their affection, they will seem more relaxed and at ease than they might otherwise."
 artifact_highland_blade_name:0 "Highland Blade"
 artifact_highland_blade_description:0 "These enchanted blades are growing increasingly rare, for the means of their construction are either lost, or the nockers aren't talking. Most common among them are claymores, though other edged variants exist. So long as the wielder possesses even one point of Glamour, they will not suffer any ill effect on account of terrain."
 artifact_rorys_bag_name:0 "Rory's Bag"
 artifact_rorys_bag_description:0 "Named for Red Rory, these are all large bags of sturdy construction, though individual models may vary on color and construction. Nevertheless, each is large enough to contain enough food and drink to sustain one adult troll for one day. If a changeling spends one point of Glamour, a full meal of travel rations will appear. Note that these are real rations and not chimerical and as such will offer real sustenance."
 artifact_shield_of_virtue_name:0 "Shield of Virtue"
 artifact_shield_of_virtue_description:0 "These large, round shields are legendary treasures and no more than two are known to exist. Said to have been the shields of the twin brothers Torvald and Bohr, each has the power to strengthen the will of an honorable troll and offer extraordinary protection in battle.

Given to the guardianship of the nockers, it opens anything it touches, regardless of whether the object is simply closed or securely locked and warded. It is powerful enough to open portals that lead to other realms, so long as they are not barred from the other side as well. Its true power, though, lies in its ability to open up the hearts of people and as a means of uncovering information that has been locked away or forgotten. It is a stimulator of memories."

 artifact_changestone_description:0 "#bold Allow to, when needing to spend Glamour, first spend the Glamour stored in this Glamour Vessel.\nAuto-refill every month.#!\nThe Changestone, a fiery ruby, was given to the satyrs to guard. It confers the power to change its holder's appearance in the mortal world and tends to alter circumstances in their favor, at times to the detriment of those around them. Its real magic, though, lies in its ability to transform someone into their true self; restoring such a one to their faerie nature. Some believe the gem can even reverse the process of mortal aging."

 artifact_shadowstone_description:0 "#bold Allow to, when needing to spend Glamour, first spend the Glamour stored in this Glamour Vessel.\nAuto-refill every month.#!\nThe Shadowstone, a black opal, was entrusted to the Menehune of Hawai'i. It has the power to absorb and transform Banality and increases the holder's ability to act "in the shadows," for example by stealth or in darkness. When used by those who understand the true interplay between Banality and Glamour, the gem can purify a changeling, cleansing them of all Banality without the unfortunate side effect of causing Bedlam. In some ways it is the most powerful and dangerous of the four stones, inevitably corrupting all but the strongest of personalities through inuring them to Banality's harshness. It sends dark dreams as well."

The ship moved freely on the waters; for a short while it could also travel on the land, through rock and tree, through the air or even across fire. Only one person was required to steer the ship, so long as the captain was of noble blood."

When charged, the weapon may be thrown to a range of 25 yards per point of its wielder's Strength. When thrown, the weapon automatically homes in on its target. Alternatively, while the weapon is in flight, the wielder can utter a command word to split the weapon into three edged shards.

The willing soul of a demon — his name long since forgotten — was bound into the black metal, where he could use this power upon anyone touched by the blade. The sword’s touch drained the energy and life from anyone it wounded — and if it killed a victim, his soul would be pulled from his corpse and imprisoned within the blade, there to be tortured and devoured by the original demon. Mortals and angels alike fell before Soultaker, their Faith torn apart for his sustenance.\nThen the sword’s bearer used it to slay another demon, and the sword changed. The two demonic souls fought for dominance within the blade, neither able to gain an advantage. Over time, their souls began to bleed into each other, creating a single fractured personality. As demonic infighting grew more serious in the war, more demons fell to Soultaker, and their souls became absorbed into a single insane entity — a being that called itself Legion. Soultaker was lost during the final days of the war, hidden deep in a forgotten weapons cache, and without new victims to devour for Faith, Legion grew weak and thin.

Genhinnom was destroyed by the angels after the rebels were sent to Hell, but a city of this power, this beauty, can never be completely destroyed.

The bird will immediately take flight and head for the requested target. It flies at a slow, but steady and unbroken pace so that its owner can follow, though anyone using the nightingale must be prepared for rough travel.

 artifact_soulfire_lantern_name:0 "Soulfire Lantern"
 artifact_soulfire_lantern_description:0 "Rather than illuminate, this lantern shrouds its holder in shadows, hiding her from sight. The lantern’s light is a 10-Pathos soulfire shard. When the user activates the crystal, stored Pathos is consumed and the lantern and its wielder vanish from sight. All that’s visible is a dim, bobbing light that, curiously enough, is also visible across the Shroud."
 artifact_star_of_the_east_name:0 "Star of the East"
 artifact_star_of_the_east_description:0 "Looking like nothing so much as a Christmas-tree ornament made from spun sugar, the Star of the East is considered an eccentric affectation by some, a lifesaving tool by others. When inactive, it will maintain an irregular orbit around its owner’s head. Once activated, however, the star immediately flies off in the direction of the most pressing danger facing the wraith. If the threat is within 10 yards, the star will hover over it. Otherwise, it will hold position in the direction of the threat for a full hour before needing to be recharged, or returning to its normal orbit."

 artifact_stygian_steel_armor_description:0 "Not many can claim to own such a prize. Highly ornate and often decorated with crests and other seemingly nonfunctional elements, the armor is actually quite serviceable. Each suit is different, ranging from expansions of hoplite armor to full-blown medieval plate mail. What matters is that in each case, the wearer’s torso is protected."

 artifact_living_chains_name:0 "Living Chains"
 artifact_living_chains_description:0 "Made from Stygian steel, not soulsteel, these chains are not used to imprison. Rather, they empower the wearer. Once activated, the chains anchor themselves in the back of their user, doing aggravated damage (which cannot be healed until the chains are removed). The remainder of the jet-black links wrap themselves around the wearer, effectively giving her the equivalent of a set of soulsteel armor as well as an offensive weapon. At the wielder’s command, the chains can strike independent targets up to 20 feet away."
 artifact_fetterguard_name:0 "Fetterguard"
 artifact_fetterguard_description:0 "Few Artifacts are more precious — or more precarious — than the Fetterguard. Appearing as nothing more than a small soulsteel box, inside it holds miniature versions of its owner’s [Fetters|E]. Each of these must be made by the wraith herself, though whether she does it through the forge, through Moliate, or through putting together bits and bobs she recovered in the [underworld|E] makes no difference. As long as these icons remain safe within the box, no harm will come to them in the real world, and even supernatural attempts at damaging them will somehow go awry."
 artifact_beasthide_name:0 "Beasthide"
 artifact_beasthide_description:0 "Beasthide is exactly what it sounds like, a square of tanned skin taken from a plasmic or other such beast. The skin is rough and scaly, and is a noxious green in color, but it does have one admirable quality. When used to polish a relic or Stygian steel blade, it somehow sharpens it beyond what it was capable of holding before. The effect lasts for the duration of the battle. The typical piece of Beasthide has a dozen uses in it before it falls to shreds."

 artifact_wail_tongue_name:0 "Wail Tongue"
 artifact_wail_tongue_description:0 "It is said that the Wail Tongue is what made Nhudri decide once and for all that he was done working with Skin Artifacts. It’s a sliver of the tongue of a plasmic, inlaid with a network of fine, Stygian-steel wire. This foul device must then be placed by a wraith in his own mouth, where it will immediately and painfully devour the wraith’s own tongue. In addition, the wraith’s speech patterns permanently change, becoming harsher, more metallic, and oftentimes flat-out chilling."
 artifact_guardian_orb_name:0 "Guardian Orb"
 artifact_guardian_orb_description:0 "Bulky but incredibly potent, this Artifact consists of a milky white, beach-ball-sized eyeball, complete with optic nerve, set within a thin circular brace made of Stygian steel. A smaller ring is worn by the Orb’s user, behind whom the Orb will bob and float. Not only does the Orb allow its owner to see behind herself, it also maneuvers itself between its owner and any incoming projective attacks. Each Orb will move to intercept anything from a paper airplane to a careening relic chariot."
 artifact_forgebait_name:0 "Forgebait"
 artifact_forgebait_description:0 "Forgebait looks like an obolus. Close examination will show that it’s a clever forgery, but most wraiths would have no reason to suspect such. The Forgebait will continue to act like an obolus (moaning, etc.) until such time as the wraith tries to use it to pay for something. At that moment, it will disintegrate into a foul-smelling slime. The stink will stay with the would-be buyer for a week, letting all who pass know that this is a wraith whose coin is not to be trusted."

However, they can up their odds if they use a Memory Net. Supposedly made from the hair and bone of a captured angelic, a Memory Net is a golden net of shimmering strands attached to a bone hoop and rod construction. The entire structure, on close examination, bears a suspicious resemblance to a human arm. The diameter of the hoop’s opening is three feet, which is the maximum size for something to be plucked from the waves."

 artifact_horn_of_distress_description:0 "These horns are meant to be sounded only in times of dire need. They vary in appearance according to culture, and often bear the marks of the maker's tribe. When successfully activated, a horn of distress alerts all werewolves, regardless of tribe, within a 10-mile radius. They may choose to answer the call or not, but they know that the horn means “Kin in trouble.” These horns usually contain peacock, goose or air-spirits."

The amulet conveys no immediate obligation to help the wearer, but most Garou know that the wearer has at least earned fair treatment. Regrettably, Black Spiral Dancers also recognize the wearer as Kinfolk, with potentially dire results."

 artifact_klaive_hammer_description:0 "While only a Garou can perform the rites necessary to create a klaive, some skilled Kinfolk smiths are trained to forge the actual weapon intended to be the spirit's vessel. A klaive hammer is a fetish designed to help the Kin create a weapon so perfect of form that it will please the spirit or spirits asked to empower it. Smith must spend Gnosis when using the hammer to craft a klaive. This expenditure is part of the process that hardens the silver of a klaive to be as strong as steel, allowing the klaive to be used in battle more reliably than an ordinary silver weapon could manage."                   
 artifact_bottle_of_fire_name:0 "Bottle of Fire"

At that point, a hot-burning liquid pours out of the bottle and moves away from the user. As it moves, the fire causes all flammable items in its path to burst into flame. When the mage has caused enough destruction, he need only replace the stopper."
 artifact_cauldron_of_spies_name:0 "Cauldron of Spies"
 artifact_cauldron_of_spies_description:0 "The cauldron of spies is a Verbena Artifact par excellence. The mage needs only fill the cauldron with water and bring it to an energetic boil and then speak the right words and out of the water will shoot a number of bats (if it’s night) or rooks (if it’s daylight). These animals are connected to the mage telepathically, and whatever they see, she sees. These creatures have a range of several miles from the mage and they last for 12 hours, at which point they dive into the nearest, deepest shadow and fade away (so that they can’t be followed back to the witch who created them)."

 artifact_salvation_bell_name:0 "Salvation Bell"
 artifact_salvation_bell_description:0 "These Charms, in the shape of small brass bells, protect their user from those who would harm her at night. When a salvation bell is struck, it radiates a warm golden light. Once the bell begins to glow, the ringer begins praying, chanting or singing in harmony with the ringing tone of the bell. So long as this prayer continues, the chime of the bell does not fade and the singer’s enemies are unable to get within 10 feet of her. Furthermore, for each voice singing in harmony with the bell, the radius of protection is increased by 10 feet. If the singer attempts to do anything else besides sing (e.g., walk, read) the spell is broken and the bell cracks."
