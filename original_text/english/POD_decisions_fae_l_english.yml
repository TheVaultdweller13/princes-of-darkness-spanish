The Seekers are comprised mainly of scholarly, hidebound fae, and as such have a relatively low-key presence in the public eye. This is the faction of the Patron Council that delves deeply into the tomes of old legends and sends out searchers on the trail of even the vaguest rumor of historical faerie lore. Lost artifacts, fragile manuscripts that speak of the past age, even weapons and items of ancient craft-these are all clues to the ways of the past, and are invaluable to the Seekers' cause."

Most of the politicians, diplomats, advisors and other social stars of the Patron Council are grouped under the term Vanguard, used without affection by everyone outside of this "faction within a faction." Needless to say, the members of this faction are a diverse breed with as many differing ideologies and agendas as there are fae themselves.

It is the source of many of the ugly rumors regarding the Patrons — tales of assassinations, ambushes, intercepted couriers, leaked communications between allied courts — all of this and more.
