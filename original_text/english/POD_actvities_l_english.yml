 brujah_panegyra_events.1000.desc: "Archery was never a part of the original Olympic games and, as such, wasn't considered suitable by the Brujah for their Panegyra. It is only after a long and grueling campaign by younger members of the clan that it was finally added as a competition. Proponents of archery tend to explain that it is the perfect embodiment of the Brujah as it requires both physical aptitude and a sharp mind.\nMost winners tend to be those younger neonates that grew up with a bow in their hands and that is by far the contest they look forward to the most. Elders tend to see it as necessary evil, an introduction to much more traditional and respected parts of the Panegyra that come after."

 brujah_panegyra_events.1010.desc: "The kerykes (heralds) were associated with the salpinktai (trumpeters) in ancient Olympics to form the Herald and Trumpet contest. The trumpet part of it was never really popular among the Brujah but the oratory competition definitely is. Winners are chosen by the clarity of the enunciation and the audibility of their voice as much as what they actually are saying. Some use poetry while others prefer old Greek political works such as Plato or Aristotle.\nBeloved by the Brujah elders, this is a contest dreaded by the other clans as it can go on for literal nights before drawing to a close. Polite requests to institute a time limit for each contestant have so far been firmly refused."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1010.b: "Let's try to not fall asleep..."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1010.c: "My voice is a sharpened weapon!"

 brujah_panegyra_events.1020.t: "Wrestling"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1020.desc: "The classic of classics, wrestling has been a fixture of the Olympics since there have been Olympics. Its rules have barely even changed since their first inception and it is still a fan favorite of the Panegyra to this night. Gangrel and Nosferatu are noted as particularly fierce contestants, often denying the Brujah victory, as they are accustomed to physical feats of strength needed to prevail here."

 brujah_panegyra_events.1030.t: "Boxing"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1030.desc: "Boxing has the dubious distinction of being both the contest that has its rules changed the most often and the one to induce frenzy in its participants the most as well. As such, it has been sometimes debated as not suitable for vampires but the push to actually remove it from the Panegyra never gained much traction.\nIt is a favorite contest of the Toreador who say they appreciate the "physical art" shown by such a contest. Snarky Brujah have been known to hint that they just want to sate their lust on the participants though as boxing, as is Greek tradition, is practiced in the nude."

 brujah_panegyra_events.1040.t: "Board Game"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1040.desc: "The first non Greek Olympics addition to the Panegyra, the board games have been a staple for a long time now. Favored by Brujah elders (and participating Lasombra), this tends to be the most politically important contest as those elders often talk during these games and some think that important decisions (or rivalries) that have shaped the Cainite world have started here.\nChess is a staple but far from the only one practiced. The judges are somewhat reluctant to quickly introduce new ones however, as some contestants have been known to try push their forgotten game from a forgotten culture with no way to check the rules, which would give them an unfair advantage."

 brujah_panegyra_events.1050.t: "Horse Race"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1050.desc: "The Greek Olympics were fond of horse racing, who were considered the most prestigious contest, and it has been mimicked by the Brujah Panegyra for centuries now. Each one has its different take on the race itself however with chariots being a glorious but rarer and rarer sight nowadays (as competent charioteers and chariot makers are scarce in this era).\nMany have transitioned to a more traditional horse race and then have to consider whether to accept ghouled horses or not. No definitive consensus has been reached on this topic and, as such, a contestant should probably inquire about it before the race, or risk being accused of cheating."

 brujah_panegyra_events.20.t: "End of the Contest"
 brujah_panegyra_events.20.desc: "[contest_winner.GetTitledFirstName] won the contest!\nThe dust settles in the arena as this part of the Panegyra draws to a close.

 brujah_panegyra_events.20.a: "Glory to the victor, woe to the vanquished."
 
 brujah_panegyra_events.13.t: "Olympia Reborn"
 brujah_panegyra_events.13.desc: "First introduced by Hellenic Brujah fascinated by the concept of the Olympic games, the Panegyra is a traditional gathering of clan Brujah in the island of Chalcis happening every decade. Sponsored games, following closely the old Greek Olympics, are the most anticipated part of the event.\nPanegyra have spread as far as clan Brujah did with the centuries and many smaller ones are held in other parts of the world. Each Panegyra tends to have its own variations, often tied to the culture of the region where it is held. All vampires are welcome to participate, though [discipline|E] usage is strictly forbidden which tends to level the playing field between the varied contestants.\nWhile most clans aren't really interested in the event, many come to at least spectate them or use them as cover for some politicking with Cainites hailing from distant lands."
 brujah_panegyra_events.13.a: "Let the games begin!"
  
 panegyra_conclusion_general: "The Panegyra has come to an end. Some have won glory, some have felt the sting of defeat and others have used the event to plot and scheme for the future. Judges are already thinking about rule changes for the next one and contestants are thinking about how to improve training regimens to do even better.\nAll in all, a success for clan Brujah, reminding the Cainite world that they are still true to their ideals of mental and physical perfection."
 
 panegyra_archery_tt: "Archery favors patience, those skilled with a bow (and having a good one also helps) and overall physically gifted contestants."
 panegyra_kerykes_tt: "Kerykes favors diplomats, poets and gregarious contestants. Shy or speech impended characters have lower chance of winning."
 panegyra_wrestling_tt: "Wrestling heavily favors physical prowess and strongly built characters."
 panegyra_boxing_tt: "Boxing favors patient, callous and skilled at duel (such as blademasters) characters."
 panegyra_board_game_tt: "Board games favor learned, patient and deceitful characters."
 panegyra_horse_race_tt: "Horse races favor skilled horsemen, stewardship inclined and diligent characters."
 
 brujah_panegyra_events.1001.t: "Tools of the Trade"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1001.desc: "Contestants in the archery games are expected to come with their own bows, which has led to a small but thriving community of bow makers taking residence near the Panegyra. Many vampires don't use bows usually so they buy one of those proposed by the artisans before the contest. Even those few Cainites coming with their own weapon will be likely to have it checked before the games begin to make sure it is in perfect condition."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1001.a: "I want the best bow in the country!"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1001.b: "Just stick two twigs together and it will be fine."

 brujah_panegyra_events.1002.desc: "As the archery contest is underway, another participant has noticed your good initial results and came to you for advice. Vampiric society being what it is, they certainly don't expect it for free and instead of the complex game of politicking usual to your kind, they instead propose a small sum of gold to hire you as a consultant of sorts for the length of this contest."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1002.a: "First, let's take about the wind..."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1002.b: "Ha! No."

 brujah_panegyra_events.1003.t: "A Little Help"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1003.desc: "Even the youngest vampire has the potential for great physical feats if they use their blood to do so. As such, it would be laughably easy to cheat during any contest favoring those. The Panegyra rules are clear though, no use of any kind of blood powers during the tournament. Brujah judges are known to be surprisingly keen on detecting any such cheating attempt.\nYou are pretty sure some (if not most) don't get caught however so you could try. It could give you a serious edge during the contest or have you disqualified if you are caught."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1003.a: "It's not cheating if I'm not caught."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1003.b: "My perfect body is all the cheating I need."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1003.c: "Cheating is for losers."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1003.d: "Caught!"
 
 brujah_panegyra_events.1011.t: "Perfect Preparation"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1011.desc: "For some of the traditionalist Brujah, the Kerykes is the most important event of the Panegyra. They spend years preparing their speech, looking for the perfect words and intonations for their (probably very long) performance during the event.\nFor an outsider, it is quite difficult to breach into this level of competition without a good amount of preparation. Though upsets have been known to happen, most likely to stop the usual contestants from thinking that they need to make an even longer speech to win."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1011.a: "I have everything perfectly planned!"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1011.b: "I could learn a thing or two from such orators."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1011.c: "Let's just get ready."
  
 brujah_panegyra_events.1012.t: "Ghost Writer"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1012.desc: "As you wander through the grounds, you notice that one of the Kerykes participants left his speech unattended while they are talking with another guest not too far from here. Such a display is quite rare and, as you confirm that nobody seems to be nearby, you smell an opportunity.\nAll is fair in war and games after all, right?"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1012.a: "Burn it! Because it's fun."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1012.b: "Steal it to hamper their performance."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1012.c: "Study it to learn from them."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1012.d: "Just give it back politely."
 
 brujah_panegyra_events.1013.t: "Ready to Talk"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1013.desc: "The main event of the Kerykes is the moment when you deliver your speech in front of the judges and the spectators. Those coming from a traditionalist background go with a very long, ponderous, speech that often earn them the respect of their peers. Younger contestants on the other hand tend to favor a more "to the point" approach and talking about more modern subjects, going as far as using the Kerykes as a platform to vent some political frustrations.\nCheating attempts are not unheard of during the contest, as mental disciplines can be quite useful to influence the jury. As always however, Brujah arbiters are watching closely from the sidelines and are ready to pronounce a swift disqualification if needed."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1013.a: "Just a little mental push..."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1013.b: "You will give me first place!"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1013.c: "For my first of hundred and sixty six points..."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1013.d: "Let just get on with it."
  
 brujah_panegyra_events.1021.t: "Eye of the Tiger"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1021.desc: "Boxing in the Panegyra has almost been elevated to an art form, mostly because some of its practitioners had literal centuries of practice to master it. If you want to compete against such intimidating opponents, you will need a serious training regimen. Thankfully, the Panegyra has ample possibilities for such training though the results are always unpredictable, the vampiric body doesn't react nearly the same as the mortal one does to such exercises."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1021.a: "Cue the montage!"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1021.b: "I'm perfect as I ever will be."
 
 brujah_panegyra_events.1022.t: "Sparring Partner"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1022.desc: "Contestants are preparing for the boxing event and many are looking for training partners to really put their skills to the test. One such contestant has approached you with a plea for such partnership. It falls to you to choose if you will give it you all, potentially giving an edge to this opponent or subtly try to undermine their potential instead."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1022.a: "Do you thing, I will just watch."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1022.b: "Faster! You can do better than that!"

 brujah_panegyra_events.1023.t: "Lashing Out"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1023.desc: "Boxing is by far the competition with the most disqualifications in the Panegyra. Having two vampires punch at each other is a recipe for easy frenzy and the contest is almost as much a match of willpower than it is a physical one. Falling into a frenzy is an instant loss but curtailing your instincts too much can also hamper your overall performance. A fine balance has to be struck to win."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1023.a: "Let it out!"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1023.b: "Let it ALL out!"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1023.c: "Calm and collected."
  
 brujah_panegyra_events.1031.t: "Game On"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1031.desc: "A large variety of board games are present during each Panegyra though most are only used for training or novelty purposes and not actual competition. Still, many vampires find these entertainments surprisingly close to some of the situation they have to face in night after night. As such, it is not uncommon for many spectators to come join the contestants during downtime, sampling in the various activities present on site."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1031.a: "A trivia game maybe?"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1031.b: "Wargames are the best!"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1031.c: "Let's just focus on the competition ahead."
  
 brujah_panegyra_events.1032.t: "Strange Rules"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1032.desc: "The mortal world has produced a lot of board games and a lot of different rulesets for each of them. It can be difficult to keep track of those, especially for vampires that are often known to be stuck in their ways. One such contestant has come to you to ask for your help understanding a particularly arcane game coming from your area. A good opportunity to show off your knowledge... or to just mock them for their failings."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1032.a: "Children know how to play this game!"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1032.b: "So during the first turn..."
  
 brujah_panegyra_events.1033.t: "Moves of the Jyhad"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1033.desc: "One of your first opponents during the board game contest clearly sees the game you are playing as a representation of the Jyhad, the so called Great Game of politics and intrigues played by the Cainites. This isn't an uncommon practice at all, as many vampires see others as pieces on a board and plan their moves decades in advance. It's rarer during an actual competition though, and your opponent seems more focused towards pushing you into making some subtle political statements with your game instead of actually playing it."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1033.a: "Just play the damn game."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1033.b: "If this piece represents this Prince, then..."
    
 brujah_panegyra_events.1041.t: "Window Shopping"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1041.desc: "Before the main event, the Panegyra has provided some entertainment with a show of mortals and ghouled wrestlers going after one another. While they certainly lack in experience and raw vampiric strength, they use some more modern tactics that could prove useful during the contest.\nThese are also quite the fine mortals specimen and you notice a few vampires looking at them hungrily, perhaps hoping for some of their likely sweet and strong blood..."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1041.a: "So appetizing!"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1041.b: "I want this one instead."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1041.c: "Just study their match."
 
 brujah_panegyra_events.1042.t: "Exhibition Match"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1042.desc: "The Panegyra judges inform you that you have been chosen for an exhibition match before the wrestling contest formally begins. This is a double edged sword as if you give it your all, you are likely to reveal your weakness and strengths to the other contestants. If you don't however you are likely to lose, which is always a shameful affair in front of so many spectators."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1042.a: "Lose to hide your tactics."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1042.b: "Win for glory!"
  
 brujah_panegyra_events.1043.t: "Fixed Match"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1043.desc: "You have been approached by the servant of an anonymous other contestant before the wrestling contest began. Identifying you as a potential threat to their victory, they offer you some gold to just throw one of your early matches, removing you as a competitor for the later stages. Panegyra judges are notoriously keen on noticing the use of vampiric powers... but also notoriously daft in considering that old fashioned cheating and fixing can also happen, so it's very unlikely you would get caught."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1043.a: "Gold is more useful than glory."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1043.b: "...but glory is eternal!"
   
 brujah_panegyra_events.1051.t: "Golden Chariot"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1051.desc: "The organizers of this Panegyra have decided that it will be a chariot race this time, a very ancient tradition dating back to the mortal Olympics. Sadly, chariots have been all but forgotten by the mortals of this dark era and getting your hands on a suitably impressive and efficient one won't be a cheap task.\nArtisans (often ghouls coming from a long line of chariot makers nurtured by vampires) are in the outskirts of the Panegyra, ready to provide their craft for your use. What will be your pick?"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1051.a: "This cheap one will more than suffice!"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1051.b: "A sturdy and solid one."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1051.c: "Only the golden chariots of old will do!"

 brujah_panegyra_events.1052.t: "Night Jousting"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1052.desc: "Joust has been a popular pastime for noble mortals for a while but has been quite slower to catch up to the much more traditionalist thinking vampires. Still, a younger generation of Cainites was born in this era and sometimes were even nobles practicing joust themselves. As such, it has gained enough traction to be sometimes featured as a Panegyra contest.\nIt is a deadly one as jousting require to not flinch, knowing full well that your opponent could subtly try to use the power of their blood to outright kill you when your lances collide."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1052.a: "Fear isn't in my vocabulary."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1052.b: "Let's take a step back before contact..."
 
 brujah_panegyra_events.1053.t: "Helpful Blood"
 brujah_panegyra_events.1053.desc: "The Panegyra organizers have decided that, this time, ghouled horses aren't allowed during the horse race contest. There will be tests as usual to make sure that no one is trying to cheat.\nThis gives you an opportunity though as you notice one unguarded stable on your road to your own. With a little bribe to the stable-hand and some of your own blood, you could transform one of the other contestants' horses into a ghoul, thus ensuring their disqualification in the process."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1053.a: "Petty schemes are best schemes."
 brujah_panegyra_events.1053.b: "...still way too petty."
