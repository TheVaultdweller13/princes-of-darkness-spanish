 POD_werewolves_maintenance.2.desc: "The First Change is the name for the first shapeshifting of a young Garou (and for most Fera). Usually it comes along with the first frenzy and the first usage of the Crinos battle-form in highly stressful situations.\nYou have just experienced this traumatic event and are now officially a werewolf, a full on member of your tribe with all the responsibilities and privileges entailed by such a role."

 POD_werewolves_maintenance.3.desc: "It seems that Gaia hasn't seen fit to bless you today: your baby is a boy. Black Fury's society is very strict on what should be done and you know it to be the way of your tribe for generations now.\nThere are a few male among your people, so you choosing to keep this child wouldn't be unprecedented if you wished to, but it would still be a very big affront to tradition and considered as a sign of weakness by your sisters. At the end of the day however, the choice is yours alone."
 POD_werewolves_maintenance.3.option.a: "A weak male has no place among us!"
