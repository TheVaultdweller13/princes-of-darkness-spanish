 POD_travel_events.1.t: "Alamut: the Eagle Nest"
 POD_travel_events.1.desc: "In the moutains of Asia Minor, if one knows where to look, there is a narrow path that branches off from the main trade road where no villages lie for dozens of miles. This route ascents the steepest of slopes, passing close by treacherous depths where cold winds howl to sweep the unwary to death on the sword sharp rocks far below. This is the road to Alamut, the Eagle's Nest, the ancient stronghold of the Banu Haqim.\nFrom the outside, Alamut is little to look at: a small hill fort made of black basalt with walls far too short and thin to withstand a siege. However, this is merely the gatehouse to the fortress.\nWithin the central structure, a wide, flat, path opens sloping down into the mountains. This is where Alamut's actual defenses begin and members of the three castes constantly maintain and supervise them. Enchantments keep its location hidden from all those who wish harm to its inhabitants.\nHere are the training halls, where a hundred warriors test their mettle. Here are countless laboratories for sorcerers to experiments on magic long lost to mankind. Here is the great library, where the viziers ponder the secrets of the universe.\nAnd here is the Black Throne of Haqim, dominating the very center of the fortress in the great hall, awaiting the return of its rightful and terrible master."

 POD_travel_events.2.t: "Ceoris: Tremere's Pride"
 POD_travel_events.2.desc: "Visitors or attackers must approach Ceoris from the treacherous, heavily fortified, foothills to its south. Unnatural rain, fog and storms shield the valley while guardsmen patrol day and night. The trail ends up in a steep incline to the gates of Ceoris. It is sufficiently rocky and winding to prevent the hauling of siege weapons to attack the chantry. Huge rocks roiled by Gargoyles provide ideal ambush spots for the defenders.\nThe approaching visitor sees nothing but fog and hears nothing but howling winds. It is a vast shaft of black rock jutting up from a manmade plateau. Its surface is unmarred by decorations, only dozens of long, narrow windows, now bricked up and sealed over with lead sheeting interrupt the perfect sheerness of its vertical surfaces. Eight towers rise up from the structure's bulk, acting as decoys as none of them give entrance to Ceoris itself. A couple of them burst into flames when weight is applied on it. Tremere can't easily stop their theatrical impulses it seems.\nA great chasm rings the chantry, with only the narrowest of bridge to traverse it. Finally the gatehouse is the last obstacle, protected by seasoned soldiers and the fiercest Gargoyles. Even if they were to be defeated, powerful magical traps await the stubborn invader. After the gatehouse finally lies Ceoris itself, the heart and soul of the soulless Tremere."

 POD_travel_events.3.t: "Carthage: Dream and Nightmare"
 POD_travel_events.3.desc: "The Brujah still draw inspiration from legends of the great scholars and philosophers that flourished in Carthage, a culture where Kindred and kine were closer to one another than any point before or since. Indeed, some Brujah (and a few others) remember Carthage as the "Third City", the spiritual and political heir of the First and Second Cities. However, other, darker tales speak of a degenerate blood cult under none other than Troile, the Antediluvian ancestor of the Brujah; of human sacrifices – including infant sacrifices – to infernal powers; and of collusion between Troile and the Baali methuselah Moloch.\nThe Ventrue of Rome were fierce rivals of their Brujah cousins in Carthage. As Moloch drew Troile into desensitization and degeneration, news of the endemic corruption among Carthaginian Brujah spread to the Roman clans. The Malkavian seeress Tryphosa gave guidance to the Roman prince Camilla directing him to act against Carthage, and the Carthaginian Toreador Helena betrayed her city to the Romans. Through the Toreador Antediluvian, Artemis Orthia, Lysander and prince Alchias an alliance formed against the Brujah of Carthage; under the leadership of the Roman Ventrue the alliance encompassed the Malkavians, Toreador, Lasombra and their allies. As the Third Punic War razed Carthage in 146 BCE, the collective forces of the Roman Cainite alliance defeated Carthage's Brujah and Baali masters. In the end, Troile and Moloch were driven into torpor, entwined in an eternal lovers' embrace beneath the salted fields of Carthage."

 POD_travel_events.4.t: "Erciyes: Cappadocius' Folly"
 POD_travel_events.4.desc: "Sometimes called the Monastery of Shadows due to its location, the high cliffs on all sides means it receives only a few hours of direct sunlight each day, Erciyes was taken over by the Cappadocians in a mass assault (the only military action in the history of the clan) sometime in the 1st century BCE, when they replaced a mountain monastery originally serving as a cult for a Malkavian. Since that time, the clan supported a temple complex at the mountain dedicated to the Cappadocian study of death and God. This temple is Christian (as Cappadocians tend to be), but is known for its strange and horrifying secrets.\nIts "sister city", Kaymakli lies nearby and bolsters an even darker reputation. The city was a hybrid community of Cappadocians and mortals; the mortals provided all the amenities and served as a herd for the undead scholars in their ranks. While hardly ideal, the arrangement seemed to be moderately satisfactory for both parties, possibly tempered both by the generally unpleasant conditions of a 9th century Turkish peasant and the generally passive and somewhat more humane attitudes of Cappadocius.\nWhen the clan was purged during the Feast of Folly, the city became a tomb for thousands of unfortunate Cappadocians. After that, the clan moved most of its activity back to Erciyes."

 POD_travel_events.5.t: "The Cathedral of Flesh: Yorak's Folly"
 POD_travel_events.5.desc: "The Cathedral is the creation, the haven, and the ward of Yorak, a childe of the Tzimisce Antediluvian. It was built to protect a germ of the Antediluvian's consciousness that Yorak was charged with, and in time it took the form of a harrowing church-fortress, sculpted from the flesh of peasants, slaves, rivals, beasts, and any number of other victims who were built into the pulsing, suppurating walls of the structure built by the methuselah and his retinue over a span of millennia.\nHowever the Cathedral is much more than that, it is a living (or perhaps undead) vessel of mad collective consciousness. The cathedral displays some very disturbing ambiance, like a pool of blood lined with sitting victims whom you can use as a chair, pillars of grafted bodies, walls of mouths that sing a wailing chorus as you pass them, or the open gallery where corpses remain impaled by stalactites. Those thick stalactites and stalagmites form the Cathedral's pillars, with bone trusses over which limestone grows and forms an osseous mix of liquid architecture. Either skulls – with their eyes and surrounding muscular structure still intact – thin enough to behold the sea of viscera and floating organs comprise the walls.\nScores of ghouls moisten the eyes so they can blink properly. Even more Revenants conduct the ritual tattooing by drawing charcoal-dusted threads through their victim's skin with bone needles. Later, Yorak and his childer would carefully slough the flesh from their screaming sacrifices, treat the flesh canvas in a preservative, and stretch it over the windows like a mosaic."

 POD_travel_events.6.t: "The Castel del Ombro: Lasombra's Lair"
 POD_travel_events.6.desc: "There are occasional mysterious phenomena associated with this place, and an old tale about how the shadows here remained intact even when lava flows from nearby Mount Etna cast their lurid red glow on everything else. Neither local residents nor visiting authorities realize how thoroughly their minds are twisted on a regular basis to hide all that is genuinely interesting about this castle at the center of the estate. To vampiric sight it is a different matter altogether.\nThe castle itself is a simple design, modified countless times over the centuries and not really depending on physical strength at all for its defenses. A long outer wall, precisely square, encloses two interior towers, also square. The eastern tower rises higher, with a spreading upper deck to allow watchers the best view of any trouble coming from the volcano as well as other directions. It is impossible to tell from a distance what the walls are made of, precisely, because animated shadows crawl over every surface in a just barely visible ebb and flow. Tides of shadow rise out of the depths after sunset each night and wrap around the castle in a generally spiral pattern, reversing after midnight to gradually drain away.\nIt is said that the gates are only opened when Lasombra himself is away from the castle, a worrying sight for the world at large."

 POD_travel_events.7.t: "The Pit of Malkav: Madness Incarnate"
 POD_travel_events.7.desc: "Tunnels run below Jerusalem, abandoned long before the city was even a thing. This labyrinth of collapsed passageways is nearly impassable in places with tall stones arches leading to cliffside drops that extend down into utter darkness. In place, the balance holding a stone passageway open may be as fragile as a bone. A single small impact, and a huge section of the corridor will fall. The passages weave in three dimensions and there are many layers besides the first.\nOne could truly wander here for eternity.\nIt is impossible to map those ruins but three locations stand out.\nThe Room of Scrawlings where the walls are covered in dark, chalky scrawlings. Maddening images assault the poor fool trying to decipher them.\nThe River of Blood, whose any Cainite trying to drink from will suffer dire consequences from its sheer toxicity.\nAnd finally, the Antediluvian fabled resting place, dreaming and sometimes calling his progeny to him. But no matter how strongly or for how long he calls, no one has ever made it to him yet."

 POD_travel_events.8.t: "The Fire Court: Eye of the Snake"
 POD_travel_events.8.desc: "The Fire Court lies near the Valley of the Kings. Using the lure of power and riches of the area, the Setites often claim would be adventurers in their clutches to be drawn to the Court.\nAnyone who enter find themselves in a deep cavern painted in a strange orange light. Paintings hang on the walls, with the most prominent one depicting a great black serpent devouring the sun. The tunnel leads to a great room carved from sandstone. Six huge statues of men and women with snakes coiled around them serve as pillars, holding the vaulted ceiling aloft. The statues' expressions are either of ecstasy or agony. The ceiling is veiled by shadows that seem to ripple with a life all their own, those with keen eyesight realize that carved snakes cover the entire ceiling. Dozens of real snakes slither around the room as well.\nA large, circular pit fire is near the center of the room. Its fire burns a ghastly green and emits an intoxicating fume. Behind the fire is a dais, stairs lead from it to a coiled stone cobra that spread its hood over a golden throne. This is where the mistress of the Fire Court sits, somehow more intimidating than anything else in this room."

 POD_travel_events.9.desc: "Nergal is a name of dread, the vampire that sold his soul to higher powers and managed to threaten the Second City with his army of demons and infernalists. His first efforts were thwarted, but after he had discerned that the resting place of the dark beast he sought to awaken was in northern Galilee, he reappeared, styling himself as Shaitan, the founder of the Baali Clan.\nConstructing the fortress of Chorazin over the tomb of Namtaru, the Bringer of Plague, he managed to excavate the dormant body and relocated it to Knossos in the Aegean Sea, constructing a great maze inspired by surface chasms and canals of the human brain. When reality itself warped around the island as Namtaru became more and more conscious, other vampires became alarmed and attacked Nergal in his stronghold. Together, the thirteen clans caused the volcano beneath Knossos to erupt, sinking Namtaru beneath the sea and apparently destroying Nergal for good.\nTo this night, Knossos is still a place that most vampires instinctively avoid, except those looking for ways to consort with beings that should not be disturbed."

 POD_travel_events.10.t: "Sernog Monastery: Tzimisce's Lair"
 POD_travel_events.10.desc: "The structure lies high atop a ridge above the treeline. An abandoned fortress looms menacingly, its blackened walls forming a dark skeleton against the sky, a shell of a building open to the stars. Attached to the fortress is an ancient cathedral, ostensibly in better condition but no less sinister than its companion building. Long ago desecrated, the land around the monastery cathedral no longer qualifies as holy ground; Cainites may tread upon the premises with impunity.\nThe cathedral's interior reflects an atmosphere of dark foreboding. The architecture seems carved from the fevered imagination of some mad designer. Grotesque carvings of beings that might be angels but resemble devils glare down upon those who pass through the archway at the entry to the former sanctuary. The air inside the cathedral has a musty, cloying odor, as if something eternally dying has embedded itself within the stones and now oozes forth its essence in a miasma of perpetual decay. Eerie moaning sounds fill the cavernous central chamber, echoing off the high vaulted beams and reverberating in a cacophony of shrill screams that mimic the cries of victims undergoing the agonies of prolonged and exquisite torture.\nThere is a trapdoor hidden beneath the altar of the church. Cut into the wooden planking of the floor, the door opens by pulling up on its iron ring. A narrow, dark stairway leads down into the crypt of the cathedral which contains a sarcophagus guarded by a small army of servitor creatures."

 POD_travel_events.11.desc: "Ask the people of Hunedoara where the castle stands and you will get a blank look. They would be very surprised to learn that older maps show a magnificent castle less than an hour from their village. The castle is unknown.\nInconnu.\nForbidding and desolate in its fading grandeur, its remains concealed from the world at large, tucked away in a rocky abode. No mortals can enter the castle, for the ritual cause all who pass within eyesight of it to feel great fear. The farther they get from it, the more faint their memories grow, until they remember it no more.\nEntering the castle is an almost impossible task, even great vampiric powers cannot force someone to avoid this fear. As such, those who do make it to the castle are usually forced to. Entrance to the castle can only be gained by a long, winding mountain path, thin and treacherous, and often with a deep chasm on its side. The outer walls are in a state of gross disrepair, and almost all of the outer buildings have collapsed, making the whole area seem more deserted and malevolent. Anyone trying to enter via any way other than the main gate are pushed back by winds, lightning and finally bursts of flame.\nInside resides the greatest concentration of vampiric power since Carthage... and something even more dangerous."

 POD_travel_events.12.desc: "Created after Etrius expressed his serious concerns about transforming House Tremere into a vampire clan too fast, Vienna soon became the safest haunt for the clan's conservative faction.\nPerched on a jagged promontory several miles to the north of the city, the Vienna chantry looks like a large and imposing hunting lodge. Its walls are composed of massive chunks of gray stone, hewn from the Earth by Etrius' magic. Massive timbers act as pillars and cross-beams throughout the structure. Every chamber is grand and oversized. An extensive network of disused chambers crisscrosses the hill on which the building stands. Etrius build those to allow room for future expansion without arousing unwanted attention.\nVienna's laboratories are large and well stocked and the library is the best that the Tremere have at their disposal outside of Ceoris. Common areas are at the same time sumptuous and forbidding. Heavy wooden furniture is padded in gold embroidered velvet. Incense of overpowering sweetness wafts from numerous copper censers. Tapestries depict Tremere, Etrius and Goratrix disapprovingly starring down at the room's occupants, while massive stag's horns, boar's heads and other trophies appear throughout the building.\nVienna lacks the elaborate protective measures of Ceoris, but the ground is still lard with ingenious traps."

Telyavel is reincarnating the souls of the dead, using them as raw material to create the metallic leaves of the Grove of Shadows.\n In order to do that, a soul would appear on top of his anvil in the form of a small person (homunculus). Telyavel would grab the soul with the tongs and plunge it into the fire. The homunculus would screamed in pain but when the smith removed the tongs from the flames, he would now be holding a hot piece of metal ready to be shaped. The smith would put the metal on the anvil and pound it while steaming blood would squirt out with each hammer blow, running along the furrows and falling into an orifice below - filling a vast sea of blood nearby. At the end of the whole process, a perfect metallic leaf would emerge and be carried out by the wind into the Grove.\nTelyavel is most notably worshiped by a bloodline known as the Telyavelic Tremere who fiercely protects the Grove."

They know the secrets that lie beyond death, visitor, for they have built their entire empire on the backs of the dead!”\n “One night, one terrible night, they will open the gate to the forbidden land and Venice will become the world, the Giovanni finally masters of a dead and barren land.”"
