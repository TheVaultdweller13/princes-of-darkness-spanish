 POD_demon_maintenance.10.desc:0 "In order to remain in Creation, a demon must inhabit a physical vessel of some kind. Demons hate their vessels, the shells they must hide inside in God’s worthless world; while better than the inescapable nothingness of the Abyss, a vessel is still a prison of sorts and every moment spent anchored in a physical body is another reason to loathe God. They look forward to the time when they can set the entire world of the material aflame, watching the glorious destruction from the comfort of their abhorrent spiritual kingdom.\n#X In game terms, Earthbound are truly immortal but must have their soul contained in a part of the material world. It can be their capital, resulting in them not being able to command troops, move their capital and being pushed back to the Abyssal Prison if they lose it. Or they can be tied to a reliquarie, an artifact that gives them more mobility, but is also much more fragile. If the reliquarie is destroyed, it's back to the Abyssal Prison again for the Demon, a very costly process to escape from.#!"
