 POD_demon_maintenance.10.t: "Vessel"
 POD_demon_maintenance.10.desc: "In order to remain in Creation, a demon must inhabit a physical vessel of some kind. Demons hate their vessels, the shells they must hide inside in God’s worthless world; while better than the inescapable nothingness of the Abyss, a vessel is still a prison of sorts and every moment spent anchored in a physical body is another reason to loathe God. They look forward to the time when they can set the entire world of the material aflame, watching the glorious destruction from the comfort of their abhorrent spiritual kingdom.\n#X In game terms, Earthbound are truly immortal but must have their soul contained in a part of the material world. It can be their capital, resulting in them not being able to command troops, move their capital and being pushed back to the Abyssal Prison if they lose it. Or they can be tied to a reliquarie, an artifact that gives them more mobility, but is also much more fragile. If the reliquarie is destroyed, it's back to the Abyssal Prison again for the Demon, a very costly process to escape from.#!"

 POD_demon_maintenance.11.desc: "The majority of demons loose in Creation are contained within reliquaries, inanimate objects created by their worshippers for them to inhabit.

 POD_demon_maintenance.15.desc: "Using human hosts allows you to travel and enjoy activities, but it has the drawback of having the hosts die quickly, like you are experiencing now.

 POD_demon_maintenance.20.t: "The Next Host"
 POD_demon_maintenance.20.desc: "The only alternative to inhabiting a reliquary for a fallen angel is to possess a human host — and until recently, this was a very poor alternative indeed. Demons can possess humans for a time, but not permanently, because the act of possession dooms the mortal to an unavoidable and hideous death within a short time. The Ritual of the Sundered Soul is a newfound possibility making the process a little easier.\n#X In game terms, you are truly immortal but must always have a host or be forced to return to the Abyssal Prison. You can pick your next host yourself via the Add Potential Host [character_interaction|E], this will also allow you to "leech" some of the attributes of the host. If you don't have a host for a time after your current one dies, you will be presented with a random cultist to use as an "emergency" host instead (with no soul leeching in that case). As you might have guessed, host characters are important to your gameplay, and you can find them in your Minions relationships tab. keep an eye on them!#!"

 POD_demon_flavor.1.t: "Memories: I Wish I Was An Angel"
 POD_demon_flavor.1.desc: "All Demons were once Angels, God's handmade creation to help him administer and watch over humans. Each Angel had a (sometimes broad, sometimes very specific) purpose ingrained into their being during Creation. This divine purpose is their very essence, and while is has been twisted and corrupted by millennia of rebellion and imprisonment, it can't never be completely washed away.\nYour growing eminence has pulled back some of those early memories from oblivion.

 POD_demon_flavor.2.desc: "Humanity was God's finest creation, or so he thought. Your purpose, as an angel, was to watch over them and guide them, but never show yourself. In truth, it was a turning point with God clearly favoring his newest creation... but also warning you to not interfere with their potential mistakes. Even if such mistakes could lead to catastrophes. Many angels were torn on this matter, with some thinking that God's conflicting orders was a test. Or that he stopped caring about them now that humanity was starting its rise.\nIn the end, some became jealous of humanity, some overprotective, some stayed on the sidelines. What about you?"

 POD_demon_flavor.3.desc: "The War in Heaven began when a prophecy came to warn the angels about an impending disaster that would befell humanity. Some, led by Lucifer, wanted to reveal themselves to the mortals to save them from this doom. Others thought that God's will to not interfere with humanity was more important than their role as wardens. Debate turned to war after Caine murdered his brother Abel, introducing the concept of violence to the nascent world.\nLucifer's rebellion lost in the end, and all rebels became the beings now known as demons, such as yourself.

This terrifying construct broke most of its inmates into a pathetic shadow of their former selves. Some still managed to find some semblance of new normality and didn't let their divine torment get the better of them. However, even this had a cost. Far from their original purpose, their very essence, the beings once known as angels became twisted beyond recognition in the hopes of finding a way to cope with being eternally barred from Heaven.\nIn the end, you were one of the lucky few who escaped but you can still feel the pull of the Prison calling back to you. And the memories of this place are coming back as well."
