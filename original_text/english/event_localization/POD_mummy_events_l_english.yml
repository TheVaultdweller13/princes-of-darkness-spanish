 podmummy.5000.t:0 "Tomb Kings"
 podmummy.5000.desc:0 "Mummies are true immortals but their souls might linger for a while in the afterlife after each "death". As such, the physical body must be properly prepared and attended to by servants during this time. In ages long gone, the great Egyptian mummies had fabulous tombs (or even pyramids) built for them to properly guard their physical form. This era is long gone however, with most of these tombs fallen into disrepair or having been looted by bandits long ago.\nStill, the need remains and you are now considering how to best prepare for your next travel into the afterlife. An option would be to use an existing tomb (perhaps even your own from ages past) and rearrange it, another one would be to build a new place of burial fit for you and away from prying eyes and greedy hands."
 podmummy.5000.a:0 "We will use an existing place."
 podmummy.5000.b:0 "Only a new tomb will do!"

 podmummy.5001.t:0 "The Right Place To Die"
 podmummy.5001.desc:0 "An important problem to assess when thinking about your tomb is its surroundings. Earthquakes, be they natural or triggered by your foes, are as potentially deadly as any pillagers. Many careless mummies found themselves buried under sand and rocks after their resurrection, having to painfully claw their way out during years, or even decades. You would very much like to avoid that fate.\nIf you know the terrain in your area well enough, you could conduct this survey yourself. Otherwise, hiring some learned people under a false pretense should be easy, if costlier."
 podmummy.5001.a:0 "I will take a thorough look."
 podmummy.5001.b:0 "I need some skilled help."

 podmummy.5002.t:0 "Tomb Politics"
 podmummy.5002.desc:0 "Humanity is always growing it seems. Remote places that were once perfect hiding places are now thriving new communities, which can spell trouble for a waking mummy. It's hard to find a place that will realistically not be touched by mortals while still being useful for you, so instead you focused your efforts on making sure the local authorities ban some area that you plan to use. It's not fail proof, but it should keep those pesky inquisitive mortals away for a while.\nStill, there is the concern that mortal authorities come and go and all this effort could be for naught in the end. Perhaps using your newfound influence for other prospects might be a wiser course of action."
 podmummy.5002.a:0 "Still the best solution."
 podmummy.5002.b:0 "Divert some influence to help the locals."
 podmummy.5002.c:0 "Give up on this area as potential for your tomb."

 podmummy.5003.t:0 "Tomb Building"
 podmummy.5003.desc:0 "Building a proper tomb takes a lot of planning. Even without going as far as the pyramids of old, a large amount of manpower, materials and skilled architects is needed. These don't come cheap or easily, and the time where mummies could simply order mortals around to do it is past. As such, it takes some planning skill and solid contacts with merchants guilds and such to achieve the needed result.\nThis large commitment could also be used to instead improve the local area if you want to put the priority of your tomb building down a little."
 podmummy.5003.a:0 "I will make this work."
 podmummy.5003.b:0 "More gold will solve any problems."
 podmummy.5003.c:0 "The tomb can wait."

 podmummy.5004.t:0 "Tomb Guards"
 podmummy.5004.desc:0 "A tomb needs guards at all time. While the physical body of the mummy lies defenseless in it, all your foes (or even just random raiders) could barge in and desecrate your sanctum. You are thus preparing your tomb guard for the special purpose of fighting in and near your place of burial. These exercises are very specialized though, and not very usable in the field of battle.\nYou could broaden the training a little, but it would likely mean less expertise in tomb guarding for your chosen defenders."
 podmummy.5004.a:0 "Tomb guards need to learn tomb guarding, nothing more."
 podmummy.5004.b:0 "We can broaden our horizons a little."
 podmummy.5004.c:0 "Actual exercises on the field would be beneficial."
 podmummy.5004.critical.failure.effect.desc:0 "Stop running into traps!"
   
 podmummy.5005.t:0 "It's A Trap!"
 podmummy.5005.desc:0 "Any tomb worth its name needs traps. While your guards can cover for most dangers, it is still likely that especially determined (or sneaky) foes will get past them. It's where well designed traps come in.\nThere are certainly merits in the good old fashioned boulders, dart throwers or pit of death but a mummy has other, more mystical, options. Using your vast array of alchemical concoctions and living statues, you could craft something really special for anyone foolish enough to enter your place of burial. It could also serve as a good training ground for new Hekau practices if you wish it."
 podmummy.5005.a:0 "Traps first, tests later."

 podmummy.5006.t:0 "Tomb Raiders"
 podmummy.5006.desc:0 "Your tomb isn't even yet finished that you already got pesky rogues trying to steal materials from the construction site or the precious jewelry starting to come in. Well, if they expected to find a sleeping mummy easy to steal from, they will be sorely disappointed.\nIt is time for you to make an example of this crew, hopefully sending a clear message to any would be adventurers to not mess with your tomb."
 podmummy.5006.a:0 "You breached into the wrong tomb!"

 podmummy.5007.t:0 "Tomb Decorum"
 podmummy.5007.desc:0 "There is a strong tradition of burying mummies with jewelry, ornamented statues and other treasures. While somewhat problematic as it tends to attract thieves, it would be considered quite cheap of you to not make sure that everything is properly adorned in an appropriate style for the tomb.\nNot using any decorum is certainly a possibility but would reflect badly on your prestigious person."
 podmummy.5007.a:0 "Adorn everything in gold!"
 podmummy.5007.b:0 "Let's stay measured."
 podmummy.5007.c:0 "Stone is decoration enough."

As the final touches are being made on your masterpiece, you are considering using this newfound knowledge for some last minutes modifications. They would be costly but could improve the overall structure and put into practice some of your newfound knowledge."

 podmummy.5010.desc:0 "As you have decided to restore an old burial site of yours, memories have been flooding back since you started working on it. Besides the nostalgic feel of this, it is also useful to remember ancient traps you laid there long ago.\nExploring this site while avoiding the tricks your ancient self prepared makes you feel like being in a contest of wits and intelligence against yourself. Quite an invigorating feeling, though sadly often overshadowed by the numerous trips to the afterlife that ended (or started) here in the past."
 podmummy.5010.a:0 "Time trial!"
 podmummy.5010.b:0 "Slow and careful."
 podmummy.5010.c:0 "I can do it in my sleep!"

 podmummy.5011.t:0 "Tomb Opening"
 podmummy.5011.desc:0 "After years of careful preparation and unplanned trials, you are finally happy with your tomb's location and layout. From now on, every time you are called back to the afterlife, your physical body will be carefully brought here by your attendants before your guards activate the traps and seal the place to prevent anyone from disturbing your eventual return.\nOnly time will tell if this place will stay hidden from humanity's sight forever or if a new one will have to be built at some point. But until then, your resting place, hopefully worthy of your magnificence, is finally complete."
