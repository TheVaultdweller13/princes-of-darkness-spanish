 beer_merchant.1.t:0 "The Beer Merchant"
 beer_merchant.1.desc:0 "A merchant enters your office, greets you properly and explains the reason for his visit: 'Travelling across this land I stayed the night at a monastery to the north of here. The friars served me the most delicious beer I have ever tasted. Beer being my trade, I inquired about the possibility of buying out a part of their sizable and ever-growing stock to sell to my clients. I was told to take this offer "higher up." My investigation into who is "higher up" has led me to you, Your Excellency. Can we make a deal?'."
 beer_merchant.a:0 "Most delicious, you say? We better sell it ourselves."
 beer_merchant.a.success.ctt:0 "You will attempt to build your own distribution network for the beer."
 beer_merchant.a.success.tt:0 "This will supplement our revenue."
 beer_merchant.a.failure.ctt:0 "Your venture into the world of business will bring only humiliation."
 beer_merchant.a.failure.tt:0 "You will lose prestige."
 beer_merchant.b:0 "A cause more holy than beer needs a man with keen senses and a talent with money."
 beer_merchant.b.success.ctt:0 "You will recruit the merchant as your agent."
 beer_merchant.b.success.tt:0 "A skilled steward will join your court."
 beer_merchant.b.failure.ctt:0 "The merchant will fail to see the benefit of joining you."
 beer_merchant.b.failure.tt:0 "He will continue his travels."
 beer_merchant.c:0 "We don't need the merchant, only his list of clients."
 beer_merchant.c.success.ctt:0 "You will get the merchant drunk and make him reveal his contacts."
 beer_merchant.c.success.tt:0 "Easy profit."
 beer_merchant.c.failure.ctt:0 "The merchant won't let himself be cut out."
 beer_merchant.c.failure.tt:0 "Your unbecoming methods will be exposed."
 beer_merchant.d:0 "We could always use a donation."
 beer_merchant.a.success.t:0 "The people can't get enough."
 beer_merchant.a.success.desc:0 "The merchant's instincts were correct; the beer is wildly popular with the consumers, and your distribution network can barely keep up with the demand."
 beer_merchant.a.success:0 "To health!"
 beer_merchant.a.failure.t:0 "No buyers to be found."
 beer_merchant.a.failure.desc:0 "Faith and conviction alone does not make one proficient at marketing; you fail to draw any attention to your product."
 beer_merchant.a.failure:0 "Beer, anyone?"
 beer_merchant.b.success.t:0 "A new calling."
 beer_merchant.b.success.desc:0 "The conversation with the merchant reveals that despite considering himself a lucky man, he always long to be a part of something greater, more meaningful than accumulating wealth. Encouraged by this confession to lift the veil of secrecy, you introduce him to the cause that has been calling him."
 beer_merchant.b.success:0 "As once you have distributed beer, you shall now distribute hope."
 beer_merchant.b.failure.t:0 "Sticking with the beer trade."
 beer_merchant.b.failure.desc:0 "Your clumsy attempts to convince the merchant of the hollowness of his earthly pursuits coupled with your inability to provide a tempting enough alternative have made him excuse himself from your office feeling perplexed and offended."
 beer_merchant.b.failure:0 "No amount of money will buy this fool's salvation."
 beer_merchant.c.success.t:0 "Straight to the buyers."
 beer_merchant.c.success.desc:0 "Your feigned concern for the establishments where the friars' beer is to be served coupled with constant refills of the merchant's cup turn his assurance into cockiness. Before the bottle is emptied, he lists his clients like a recitation. Your plan worked like a charm, and the fact that your secretary, hidden behind the door, carefully takes notes is the paramount of your evening."
 beer_merchant.c.success:0 "What is it that you wanted, again?"
 beer_merchant.c.failure.t:0 "The merchant is wise to your trickery."
 beer_merchant.c.failure.desc:0 "As you propose another drink, the merchant suddenly looks at you suspiciously and reminds you of the virtue of temperance."
 beer_merchant.c.failure:0 "Oh well, keep your secrets."
 beer_merchant.d.t:0 "A deal is made."
 beer_merchant.d.desc:0 "You have more important tasks ahead of you than peddling beer, and money upfront is your favourite type of arrangement."
 beer_merchant.d.done:0 "Pleasure doing business with you."
 heretic_event.1.t:0 "Heretic Undermining Nobility"
 heretic_event.1.desc:0 "A local noble approaches you with a matter that he considers demanding your attention. A charismatic preacher has taken residence in his holding and started rousing the serfs against their lord by citing the Holy Bible as supposedly condemning any pledges and oaths of allegiance. He believes this subversive doctrine to be undermining the mandate of his power and wants you to take care of this troublesome revolutionary."
 heretic_event.1.a:0 "Dealing with heretics is not exactly our jurisdiction."
 heretic_event.1.b:0 "He claims to know the Scripture? Let's see about that."
 heretic_event.1.c:0 "You want him burnt? Sure, we can burn him."
 heretic_event.1.a.success.ctt:0 "You will dazzle the noble with nebulous descriptions of your superior position in the church hierarchy."
 heretic_event.1.a.success.tt:0 "You will gain prestige."
 heretic_event.1.a.failure.ctt:0 "The noble will conclude that you're some slothful embezzler of church funds."
 heretic_event.1.a.failure.tt:0 "You will lose prestige."
 heretic_event.2.t:0 "A Theological Debate"
 heretic_event.2.desc:0 "The preacher believes his claims to be backed by the Holy Bible, but literacy alone does not grant one the knowledge needed to interpret Scriptures into doctrine. We will test this knowledge of his by engaging him in a theological debate on his ideas. The question is what we are aiming to accomplish."
 heretic_event.2.a:0 "Make him incriminate himself by cornering him into an admission of heresy."
 heretic_event.2.a.success.ctt:0 "The preacher will expose himself as a heretic."
 heretic_event.2.a.success.tt:0 "You will punish the heretic and gain piety"
 heretic_event.2.a.failure.ctt:0 "The preacher will defend his theses without speaking against established church doctrine."
 heretic_event.2.a.failure.tt:0 "A decision will have to be made."
 heretic_event.2.b:0 "Make him see the pitfalls of insufficient education."
 heretic_event.2.b.success.ctt:0 "You will impress the preacher with your superior theological knowledge."
 heretic_event.2.b.success.tt:0 "The preacher will join your court."
 heretic_event.2.b.failure.ctt:0 "You will fail to make the preacher see the error of his ways."
 heretic_event.2.b.failure.tt:0 "The preacher will go free, and you'll lose prestige."
 heretic_event.211.t:0 "The heretic meets the pyre"
 heretic_event.211.desc:0 "Using the Holy Scriptures to stir up trouble is not a worthwhile endeavour."
 heretic_event.212.t:0 "The preacher avoids incriminating himself."
 heretic_event.212.desc:0 "By choosing his words carefully and building his arguments upon universally accepted assumptions, the preacher managed to make his case without venturing into the territory of heresy."
 heretic_event.212.a:0 "The eloquent ones are the worst sort, burn him."
 heretic_event.212.a.tt:0 "You will execute the preacher without a formal justification."
 heretic_event.212.b:0 "I guess we'll have to let him go."
 heretic_event.212.b.tt:0 "The preacher will walk free."
 heretic_event.2121.t:0 "Guilty unless proven innocent."
 heretic_event.2121.desc:0 "The preacher may be a skilled and careful orator, but he is still a heretic. You know how sinful the implications that lie behind his nebulous allusions are. He may not be willing to admit guilt, but his troublesome antics are enough to sentence him to death. As you issue the sentence, something is nagging at you, the situation reminds you of something, but you can't quite put the finger on it."
 heretic_event.2121.a:0 "What I have written, I have written."
 heretic_event.2122.t:0 "The preacher goes free."
 heretic_event.2122.desc:0 "With no proof of heresy, there is no heretic for you to sentence."
 heretic_event.221.t:0 "The preacher joins your cause."
 heretic_event.221.desc:0 "Impressed with you knowledge and piety, the preacher decides to continue education at your side." 
 heretic_event.222.t:0 "The preacher leaves triumphant."
 heretic_event.222.desc:0 "You lost control of the discussion and a reason to keep the preacher captive with it." 
 heretic_event.11.t:0 "The noble is impressed"
 heretic_event.11.desc:0 "The noble is more impressed than upset with your indirect suggestion that you're too important to help him."
 heretic_event.12.t:0 "The noble is disappointed"
 heretic_event.12.desc:0 "Your refusal to help diminished your standing with local nobility."
 heretic_event.3.t:0 "The heretic meets the pyre"
 heretic_event.3.desc:0 "We may never know for sure if he was meeting the formal criteria to be called a heretic, but he sure burns like one."
 defeated_general.1.t:0 "The Defeated General"
 defeated_general.1.desc:0 "One of your office clerks approaches you with a matter most delicate. He is a confessor to a once prominent and celebrated but now disgraced general. Ever since a campaign he was tasked to lead turned disastrous, the temptation of a grave sin haunts him, the sin of taking his own life. The clerk feels powerless to prevent it and turns to you, hoping you will do better at restoring hope to this defeated man. You both visit his residence. The servant lets you into the commander's office, where you see him slumped in an armchair. Sometime after brief and awkward introductions, the general tells you: 'I just can't live like that, with this shadow of lost glory crushing me.'."
 defeated_general.1.a:0 "My good man, the days of true glory are still ahead of you!"
 defeated_general.a.success.ctt:0 "You will reinvigorate the general's spirit by convincing him to commit himself fully to your cause."
 defeated_general.a.success.tt:0 "The general joins you free from despair."
 defeated_general.a.meh.ctt:0 "The general will give working for you a chance, but his spirit will remain broken."
 defeated_general.a.meh.tt:0 "The general joins you as a broken man."
 defeated_general.a.failure.ctt:0 "Nothing convinces the general that joining your cause will make matters any better."
 defeated_general.a.failure.tt:0 "The general will take his life."
 defeated_general.1.b:0 "Tell me about that campaign."
 defeated_general.b.success.ctt:0 "You will engage the general in a conversation about military matters that will let him air his grief."
 defeated_general.b.success.tt:0 "You will gain a mentor in matters of warfare."
 defeated_general.b.failure.ctt:0 "The general will be discouraged from opening up by your lack of understanding."
 defeated_general.b.failure.tt:0 "The general will find no solace in your company."
 defeated_general.1.c:0 "We can make sure you have a Christian burial for a donation."
 defeated_general.1.c.tt:0 "You will facilitate the general's suicide for financial gain."
 defeated_general.111.t:0 "A New Purpose"
 defeated_general.111.desc:0 "'Enemies more dreadful than Saracens... A secret war waged for millennia... A mission from the Holy Father himself... Yes, yes, I can see how that would make my past career missteps relatively insignificant. Your Excellence, you have my allegiance!'"
 defeated_general.111.a:0 "In hoc signo vinces!"
 defeated_general.112.t:0 "Reluctant Service"
 defeated_general.112.desc:0 "'I don't know about any of that "holy purpose" business, but if you need a commander, I guess commanding soldiers beats rotting here.'"
 defeated_general.112.a:0 "I guess so as well."
 defeated_general.113.t:0 "When Hope Is Slipping"
 defeated_general.113.desc:0 "'Return to service? So that more good men can die because of me? Never! Get out of my house, now!.'"
 defeated_general.113.a:0 "Did I hear a stool falling over?"
 defeated_general.21.t:0 "Learning From Past Mistakes"
 defeated_general.21.desc:0 "The general begins his tale but hesitates when he gets to the troublesome part of his story. The opportunity to have someone eager to hear him out and to listen attentively convince him to continue. You reassure the general that nobody could condemn his decisions given the information he had at that time. Hearing that from someone with apparent extensive knowledge of military matters is a tremendous relief for the tortured man. After he finishes the story, you spend hours more discussing military strategy. As you finally depart, the servant whispers, 'Thank you, I haven't seen him smile since the war.'"
 defeated_general.21.a:0 "Let's make this a regular thing!"
 defeated_general.22.t:0 "The Soldier's Plight Misunderstood"
 defeated_general.22.desc:0 "The general starts telling his story but rapidly concludes that any attempt to explain his tragedy is a waste of time. The perplexed look that inhabits your face while you ask questions betraying your lack of military knowledge betrayed your good intentions. 'Let's say... things turned terrible. Perhaps I shall elaborate some other time. I beg your forgiveness, my honourable guests, but I'm completely exhausted for the moment.'"
 defeated_general.22.a:0 "Perhaps I should have come better prepared."
 defeated_general.3.t:0 "A Vulture's Feast"
 defeated_general.3.desc:0 "The general looks briefly shocked after realizing what it is that you are proposing. Quickly, relief and determination overcome the grim look on his face. 'Fine, I shall include you in my will. I have to say I did not expect that to be the outcome of this meeting. But guess I have always been the fool. Farewell."
 defeated_general.3.a:0 "Pecunia non olet, as they say."
 donors_daughter.1.t:0 "The Donor's Daughter"
 donors_daughter.1.desc:0 "An abbey hosting your regional base of operations is visited by a young noblewoman. She introduces herself as a daughter of a recently deceased friend of the cause, yet remains unaware why her father supplied you with funds and was tasked by her siblings to investigate. Reading between the lines of her introduction makes it clear that the donor must have failed to prepare a written will and his children's decision to honour his dying wish of devoting a share of their inheritance to your cause will depend on this girl's impression of you.\n\n'Will Your Excellence show me around? I want to see everything that you do here.' - she asks."
 donors_daughter.1.a:0 "With pleasure, my lady, but you see, the wings are under renovation..."
 donors_daughter.1.a.success.tt:0 "You'll convince the girl to skip the sensitive sections."
 donors_daughter.1.a.failure.tt:0 "The girl will see through your excuses."
 donors_daughter.1.a.success.ctt:0 "The visit will have a more favourable outcome."
 donors_daughter.1.a.failure.ctt:0 "The visit will have a less favourable outcome."
 donors_daughter.1.b:0 "Umm... sure."
 donors_daughter.1.c:0 "We host visitors in the main hall, everything else is off-limits."
 donors_daughter.2.t:0 "The Donor's Daughter: Your talented staff"
 donors_daughter.2.desc:0 "As you walk through the main hall, the young noblewoman notices the monk scribes handling your documents.\n'Oh, I heard a choir of monks singing one time at my aunt's funeral, it was so beautiful! Please, make them sing for me.' - she pleads."
 donors_daughter.2.a:0 "Believe me, child, these monks are terrible singers."
 donors_daughter.2.a.success.tt:0 "The girl will be charmed by your concern for her ears."
 donors_daughter.2.a.failure.tt:0 "The girl will consider her wishes disrespected."
 donors_daughter.2.a.success.ctt:0 "The visit will have a more favourable outcome."
 donors_daughter.2.a.failure.ctt:0 "The visit will have a less favourable outcome."
 donors_daughter.2.b:0 "You heard the lady."
 donors_daughter.2.c:0 "Their task here is not to entertain guests."
 donors_daughter.3.t:0 "The Donor's Daughter: A Tempting Garment"
 donors_daughter.31.desc:0 "When you reach your office chamber the visitor's gaze turns towards the headcap of Saint Wiborada a holy relic you proudly display on a dedicated stand. 'What a peculiar garment, I've never seen one in this style. It must be very old. I want to try it on!' she exclaims as the office clerks turn to you with worried expressions.."
 donors_daughter.32.desc:0 "When you reach your office chamber the visitor's gaze turns towards the veil of Saint Belina, a holy relic you proudly display on a dedicated stand.

 donors_daughter.3.a:0 "My lady, that thing is awfully dusty."
 donors_daughter.3.a.success.tt:0 "The girl will consider that an excuse."
 donors_daughter.3.a.failure.tt:0 "The girl will reevaluate the garment's appeal."
 donors_daughter.3.a.success.ctt:0 "The visit will have a more favourable outcome."

 donors_daughter.3.b:0 "Go ahead."
 donors_daughter.3.c:0 "Forget it, missy."
 donors_daughter.4.t:0 "The Donor's Daughter: Decision Time"
 donors_daughter.4.desc:0 "After you finally managed to bore the young lady senseless by listing all the charitable initiatives her father's money helped funding, both those actually taking place and those serving as cover for other operations, she decided she's seen and heard enough. You will know the extent of her generosity before she departs."
 donors_daughter.4.a:0 "She seemed to love it here."
 donors_daughter.4.b:0 "Let's hope she enjoyed her stay."
 donors_daughter.4.c:0 "Let's hope she enjoyed her stay."
 donors_daughter.4.d:0 "It's probably best if she just leaves."
 donors_daughter.4.e:0 "I couldn't care less if the brat had a good time."
 donors_daughter.5.t:0 "The Donor's Daughter: Charmed Beyond Expectations"
 donors_daughter.5.desc:0 "'Your Excellence is the most magnanimous servant of Christ I have ever met. I'm still not entirely sure what you're doing here, but whatever it is, with you at the helm it deserves every piece of silver my family set aside but also a personal donation from me.'"
 donors_daughter.5.a:0 "It was a pleasure, my lady."
 donors_daughter.6.t:0 "The Donor's Daughter: Adequate Hospitality"
 donors_daughter.6.desc:0 "'Your Excellence is as pious as your cause and it would be impious of me to leave here without donating the entire sum I was authorized to part with. My father always managed our money well and I see this is no exception. Godspeed.'"
 donors_daughter.6.a:0 "Farewell then."
 donors_daughter.7.t:0 "The Donor's Daughter: Lacking Hospitality"
 donors_daughter.7.desc:0 "'I think I've seen enough. I can't say I quite understand my father's devotion to supporting your endeavours, but if parting with this sum keeps me safe in the knowledge that his dying wish was fulfilled, so be it. Farewell, Your Excellence.'"
 donors_daughter.7.a:0 "That was barely worth the time."
 donors_daughter.8.t:0 "The Donor's Daughter: Bad Impressions"
 donors_daughter.8.desc:0 "'Your Excellence's hospitality leaves much to be desired. I've never known my father to associate himself with such unpleasant individuals and whatever his business with you was, it is not something we wish to continue in this family. Farewell to you.'"

 donors_daughter.9.t:0 "The Donor's Daughter: Paradigm Shift"
 donors_daughter.9.desc:0 "'Your Excellence disregarded my every request and made no effort to accommodate me in a way that befits a noblewoman, I feel I should turn on my heel and leave you with nothing, but at the same time I am awe-stricken by your dignity and focus. All my life I have been pampered and surrounded by sycophants reaching for scraps of my family wealth, you are different. It's clear your calling directs your eyes above this pettiness and whatever it is, I want to be a part of it. Staying here was never a part of the agreement I made with my brothers and I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to represent the estate if I made that choice, but I beg you, Your Excellence, free me from this meaningless, profligate existence and let me serve you.'"
 donors_daughter.9.a:0 "You have much to learn, my child."
