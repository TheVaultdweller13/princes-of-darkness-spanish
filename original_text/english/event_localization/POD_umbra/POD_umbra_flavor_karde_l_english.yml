 POD_spirit_travel.1300.desc:0 "The Periphery can be a beautiful place at times. When humanity dreams and hopes, the material world's reflection on the Periphery is as beautiful as it can ever be, soothing any visitors with a warm sensation of peace and safety.\nDreams never last however, and these fleeting moments are best savored whenever you can."

Some of them can be quite talkative about their past culture and welcome a conversation partner willing to learn about it. Nostalgia is a strong feeling for the lost and damned.\nAs you listen to one such wraith, your minds wanders and you can almost feel yourself living in that time and place alongside them..."

Genbu is a slow but powerful thinker, often mistaken for a Totem of Wisdom because of his reliance upon thought to solve problems, but he also enjoys using thought to outwit his foes. He is a cunning enemy, ordinarily underestimated, and his elaborate schemes are often bizarre and unpredictable.\nThis chance encounter might be an unique opportunity to secure his help, if you are able to show him that you are worthy of course."

 POD_spirit_travel.1700.desc:0 "Inside the [vulgate|E] can be found the River of Language. As its name would imply, this river is a spiritual representation of mankind's many languages. You have heard from a passing spirit that the further up the river you go, the more ancient the languages found there are.\nYou could try to drink from it at those specific points to obtain some lost knowledge, but instantly learning an ancient tongue can be quite costly to the mind."

Things like a chair, the sky being above people and other simple concepts that humanity don't think about too much and takes for granted.
