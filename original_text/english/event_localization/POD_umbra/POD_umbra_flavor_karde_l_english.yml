 POD_spirit_travel.1300.t: "Dream is my Reality"
 POD_spirit_travel.1300.desc: "The Periphery can be a beautiful place at times. When humanity dreams and hopes, the material world's reflection on the Periphery is as beautiful as it can ever be, soothing any visitors with a warm sensation of peace and safety.\nDreams never last however, and these fleeting moments are best savored whenever you can."
 POD_spirit_travel.1300.a: "So calm..."
 POD_spirit_travel.1300.b: "It's not soothing. It's boring!"
 
 POD_spirit_travel.1301.t: "Gateways to Dreams"
 POD_spirit_travel.1301.desc: "The most Dreamlike area of the [umbra|E], the Periphery represents this strange state of not complete consciousness between sleeping and full awakening.\nAs such, it is a very strange place, similar to the material world but not quite. It is where people hope, pray or fear for tomorrow. It is bliss and pain at the same time, and it would be easy to get lost in those extreme sensations."
 POD_spirit_travel.1301.a: "Better move on..."
 POD_spirit_travel.1301.b: "Life is a struggle."

 POD_spirit_travel.1302.t: "Intruding on Dreams"
 POD_spirit_travel.1302.desc: "Almost everyone has access to the Periphery in a way, since it's where dreams are formed and given substance. For a practiced [umbra|E] traveler (such as yourself) it is not very difficult on intrude on other people's dreams. There is no way to know who exactly you are messing with though, so it's really a shot in the dark."

 POD_spirit_travel.1302.b: "Let's not be mean."

 POD_spirit_travel.1400.t: "You See Dead People"
 POD_spirit_travel.1400.desc: "The [shadowlands|E] are a dry and hopeless place, even for wraiths. All beings here are condemned to a slow agony until their inevitable descent into [oblivion|E]. It's hard to not feel haunted by the surrounding despair and staying for long will take its toll on even the most hardiest of souls."
 POD_spirit_travel.1400.a: "I must move on."
 POD_spirit_travel.1400.b: "Hello darkness my old friend!"
 
 POD_spirit_travel.1401.t: "Cemetery of Civilizations"
 POD_spirit_travel.1401.desc: "Death waits for no one and the [shadowlands|E] are full of wraiths from foreign (or even long gone) civilizations. Some of them can be quite talkative about their past culture and welcome a conversation partner willing to learn about it. Nostalgia is a strong feeling for the lost and damned.\nAs you listen to one such wraith, your minds wanders and you can almost feel yourself living in that time and place alongside them..."
 POD_spirit_travel.1401.a: "Time for a change!"
 POD_spirit_travel.1401.b: "I'm fine with who I am."
 
 dead_insight_modifier: "Insight from the Grave"

 POD_spirit_travel.1402.t: "Knowledge from Beyond"
 POD_spirit_travel.1402.desc: "The lost souls confined to the [shadowlands|E] come from all corners of the Earth and you can find a surprising amount of insight from them. Wraiths are notoriously cagey however and actually learning from them takes a no small amount of effort. If you are willing to stay a little longer in the Kingdom of the Dead, you might convince some of them to teach you some useful knowledge."
 POD_spirit_travel.1402.a: "I have time."
 POD_spirit_travel.1402.b: "I won't overstay my welcome."

 POD_spirit_travel.1500.t: "Back to Nature"
 POD_spirit_travel.1500.desc: "The [spirit_wilds|E] are a spiritual representation of Earth in its purest, most natural form. In many ways, it is an untamed and wild paradise but it is not completely isolated from the material world either. Corruption brought by humankind can be seen creeping in place where civilizations are especially powerful."
 POD_spirit_travel.1500.a: "Civilization? A plague!"
 POD_spirit_travel.1500.b: "Progress can't be stopped."
  
 POD_spirit_travel.1501.t: "The Black Tortoise"
 POD_spirit_travel.1501.desc: "You chanced upon the elusive Genbu, a wizened old tortoise spirit. Genbu is a slow but powerful thinker, often mistaken for a Totem of Wisdom because of his reliance upon thought to solve problems, but he also enjoys using thought to outwit his foes. He is a cunning enemy, ordinarily underestimated, and his elaborate schemes are often bizarre and unpredictable.\nThis chance encounter might be an unique opportunity to secure his help, if you are able to show him that you are worthy of course."
 POD_spirit_travel.1501.a: "Tricking a trickster."
 POD_spirit_travel.1501.effect.success.desc: "Genbu is impressed!"

 POD_spirit_travel.1502.t: "The Savage World"
 POD_spirit_travel.1502.desc: "As a spiritual representation of the natural state of the world, the [spirit_wilds|E] are a wild place inhabited by all manners of creatures extinct in the material world (or that never existed in it in the first place). Most of them aren't exactly the friendly kind and a pack of those has spotted you and decided that you would make a perfectly acceptable meal. You might want to avoid that fate."
 POD_spirit_travel.1502.a: "Man versus wild!"
 POD_spirit_travel.1502.b: "Run away!"

 POD_spirit_travel.1600.t: "Overload"
 POD_spirit_travel.1600.desc: "The [astral_plane|E] is the realm of ideas, thoughts and inventions. Clearly a great place to learn a lot... but perhaps too much of a great place actually. There is so many to take in here, unexplored possibilities, crazy potential... the human brain is just not made for that kind of limitless exploration. You can feel yourself drifting away, slowly losing yourself to this infinity..."
 POD_spirit_travel.1600.a: "So many possibilities!"

 POD_spirit_travel.1601.t: "Rationality"
 POD_spirit_travel.1601.desc: "The [astral_plane|E] is a complete representation of the limitless potential of ideas and thoughts. Everything is possible to the learned visitor if they have the willpower to stay and listen. This ethereal and formless amalgam of ideas has little patience for silly concepts such as "sociability" however and each time your learn something, you can feel yourself more and more annoyed at the prospect of having to talk to other beings at some point again."
 POD_spirit_travel.1601.a: "Who needs friends?"
 POD_spirit_travel.1601.b: "I know enough."
   
 POD_spirit_travel.1602.t: "Redirection"
 POD_spirit_travel.1602.desc: "There are too many ideas floating in the [astral_plane|E] for you to explore but there might be another option to consider in order to exploit the potential of this place. Ideas love to find a new "home" in the material world and, with the proper willpower, you might be able to gently push one into the dreams and thoughts of a person close to you. Then, who knows what might result of this "sudden" inspiration?"
 POD_spirit_travel.1602.a: "I will guide you to your new host."
 POD_spirit_travel.1602.b: "I'm not a muse."
     
 POD_spirit_travel.1700.t: "The River of Language"
 POD_spirit_travel.1700.desc: "Inside the [vulgate|E] can be found the River of Language. As its name would imply, this river is a spiritual representation of mankind's many languages. You have heard from a passing spirit that the further up the river you go, the more ancient the languages found there are.\nYou could try to drink from it at those specific points to obtain some lost knowledge, but instantly learning an ancient tongue can be quite costly to the mind."
 POD_spirit_travel.1700.a: "Here maybe?"
 POD_spirit_travel.1700.b: "This place looks like the Nile."
 POD_spirit_travel.1700.c: "Interesting small effluent here."
 POD_spirit_travel.1700.d: "Nothing interesting."

 POD_spirit_travel.1701.t: "Dumbing Down"
 POD_spirit_travel.1701.desc: "The [vulgate|E] is where the most basic impressions and ideas are given form. Things like a chair, the sky being above people and other simple concepts that humanity don't think about too much and takes for granted. As such, this place is quite peaceful and appeasing but not very stimulating intellectually. You could easily get lost drifting away, thinking simple thoughts, if you are not careful."
 POD_spirit_travel.1701.a: "Fire is hot."
 POD_spirit_travel.1701.b: "Time to think about the politics in my realm."

 vulgate_understanding_modifier_desc: "It makes sense I guess?"
 
 POD_spirit_travel.1702.t: "Low Philosophy"
 POD_spirit_travel.1702.desc: "As the place where the most basic ideas and concepts of humankind are taking form, the [vulgate|E] is home to some... peculiar spirits. These "philosophers" have had an eternity to ponder the most simple truths of the universe and then came up with some "interesting" solutions.\nYou made the mistake of being caught in one of their arguments and are completely baffled about the way they are making simple ideas sound so complex. Philosophers are the same everywhere it seems."
 POD_spirit_travel.1702.a: "I was wrong all along!"
 POD_spirit_travel.1702.b: "That doesn't make any sense!"
 POD_spirit_travel.1702.c: "I guess it makes some kind of sense..."

 POD_spirit_travel.1800.t: "Peace and Quiet"
 POD_spirit_travel.1800.desc: "Resembling the Himalayas they call their home, the tribal homelands of the Stargazers is a place of self reflection covered with majestic and peaceful landscapes as far as the eye can see. For a member of this tribe it is well and truly home, the place where they can find themselves and finally understand their inner truth."

 POD_spirit_travel.1801.t: "The Five Tests"
 POD_spirit_travel.1801.desc: "The Tribal Homelands of the Stargazers is a place of contemplation, but also a place designed to test the Garou both physically and mentally. As a Stargazer yourself, you are welcomed to try any of the five training courses. You know very well that you are expected to fail a lot along the way however, which might not be the most prestigious thing for your brethren to see."

 POD_spirit_travel.1802.t: "Unwelcome Visitor"
 POD_spirit_travel.1802.desc: "The Tribal Homelands of the Stargazers isn't a friendly place to outsiders of the tribe like yourself. While its inhabitants aren't outright hostile, they make a point on misleading you and keeping you away from the really important places in the realm. Even simple discussions with them end up with you feeling more confused after their answers than you were before asking your questions."
 POD_spirit_travel.1802.a: "I shouldn't stay here for long."
 
 POD_spirit_travel.1900.t: "Love is a Mountain"
 POD_spirit_travel.1900.desc: "The [spires|E] act as a passageway between the [vulgate|E] and the Epiphamies. It is a chain of very high mountains each representing one of the core concepts experienced by humanity since the dawn of time. To navigate the Spires, you have to metaphorically climb one of those mountains, relying on your own vision and interpretation of the concept associated with it.\nLuck has it that you started your journey near the spiritual representation of love, which is now testing your knowledge of this difficult subject."

 POD_spirit_travel.2000.desc: "Once an open ground for adventurers and spiritual philosophers, the [grand_hall|E] has been taken over during the first century C.E. by a race of mysterious sentinels. Their primary purpose seems to make sure that people don't loiter around in the [grand_hall|E] like they used to. Basically, do your business here and then move on is their motto.\nTheir presence and their constant suspicious looks at you make this otherwise pleasant realm a more stressful stay than you anticipated."

 POD_spirit_travel.2001.t: "Wandering Around"
 POD_spirit_travel.2001.desc: "The [grand_hall|E] is actually quite a misnomer. It's mostly a very large maze of corridors in a Classical Mediterranean style. As with most things in the [umbra|E], it is also constantly shifting, meaning that you can wander around quite possibly forever and still discover new things. Some of the potential discoveries aren't as benign as the others though, so you never know what will be the ultimate result of such wandering in the end."

One of the sentinels, the self appointed guardians of this realm, explains to you that these statues were once visitors that thought they were above the sentinels' laws for this place. Evidently, they were wrong.\nThe sentinel concludes his story by advising you to not show the same arrogance."

 POD_spirit_travel.2100.t: "Facing the Mirror"
 POD_spirit_travel.2100.desc: "Always moving between realms, the Mirror Zone is a disturbing presence in the [umbra|E]. It causes localized hallucinations that are at once impossible and highly personal. Past lovers, dead enemies, and other personal relations all await you inside.\nMercifully, these hallucinations are just temporary and can actually be a good way to reinforce your psyche for the trials ahead. Still, right here and now, it would take quite a toll on your sanity."
