 POD_spirit_travel.1001.a:0 "Let's go back." 
 
 POD_spirit_travel.1001.t:0 "Exploration"
 POD_spirit_travel.1001.desc:0 "The option in the bottom of the panel represents umbral realms that you can visit. The option in the left side of the panel is the subrealm/realm location.\nAn umbral realm can be of one of six different types depending on the color of the option's background: [astral_reaches|E], [dreaming|E], [spirit_wilds|E], [underworld|E], [deep_umbra|E] and areas that don't belong in those five. The first five need the corresponding trait or perk to access. As such, an umbral realm is hidden if you don't meet the requirement, like being in a coast/sea region, having the right trait/faith or be past a certain date."
 
 POD_spirit_travel.1002.t:0 "Action"
 POD_spirit_travel.1002.desc:0 "The right side of the panel lists actions that can be used in the umbral realm, including a map that allows you to fast travel to the starting point.\nSome umbral realms have rulers which allows you to exchange grace (representing favor with these rulers) for benefits.\nWhen you find an interest, you can use an action to start an umbra expedition, which opens a map that contains challenges, random events and duels. The more stressed you are, the more duels will be generated on the path."
 
 POD_spirit_travel.1003.t:0 "Interest"
 POD_spirit_travel.1003.desc:0 "You can station an umbra explorer in the bottom right of the panel if the umbral realm permits it. The explorer needs to have the ability to travel the umbra.\nExplorers will report interesting events they find in the umbra, and raise knowledge level about the umbral realm they are exploring. This gives benefits that you can see if you mouse over the corresponding knowledge level icon."
 
 POD_spirit_travel.1004.t:0 "Danger"
 POD_spirit_travel.1004.desc:0 "If the name of the umbral realm is colored in red, this means that this umbral realm is a dangerous location. Entering it will cause you to be unable to use interactions on other characters or even be trapped in this place. You also usually won't gain beneficial umbra interests with a stationed explorer in it.\nWhen a great maelstrom happens, all [underworld|E] realms will turn into a dangerous location.\nOblivion has a skull icon for a reason. Don't enter Oblivion."

His tainted kin hunted him and nearly killed him, but he was rescued by Bone-Whittler, a Theurge, who was possessed by the White Howler ancestor Aidan Farwatcher. He managed to warn the Garou Nation that the White Howlers were lost before he died.\nAfter his death, he was unable to become an Ancestor Spirit, because the Tribal Homeland of the White Howlers had been transformed by Wyrm taint. He instead descended into the Dark Umbra, where he roamed as a wraith. Tortured by his memories, he barely staved off [oblivion|E], until a small pack of Black Spiral Dancers visited the Dark Umbra. Coruroc tried to reason with them and, when his inquiries were met with mockery, extracted their souls from their bodies, turning them into wraiths themselves. He spent long years to purge them of their Wyrm taint and formed them into a small pack of his own. This pack now travels the Shadowlands, seeking to destroy the spirits of corrupted White Howler Kinfolk or convert (and, if necessary, destroy) other Black Spirals.\nAfter finding him, he offers a pact of mutual help if you can complete a quest."

As the founder of the Peripatetic school of philosophy in the Lyceum in Athens, he began the wider Aristotelian tradition that followed, which set the groundwork for the development of modern science. Aristotle's later life was mired by his worsening relationship with his once pupil, Alexander. Forced to flee his home in Athens, his death was inglorious for such a revered monument of philosophical thought, which might have been the cause of his departure to Charon's realm after his death.\nInterested by the mortal world as most wraiths tend to be, you have easily convinced him to visit your court."

She wrote a commentary on Diophantus's thirteen-volume Arithmetica, and another commentary on Apollonius of Perga's treatise on conic sections.\nAs an inventor, Hypatia constructed astrolabes and hydrometers. She was tolerant towards Christians and taught many Christian students, including Synesius, the future bishop of Ptolemais. Hypatia was widely beloved by pagans and Christians alike and she established great influence with the political elite in Alexandria. Towards the end of her life, Hypatia advised Orestes, the Roman prefect of Alexandria, who was in the midst of a political feud with Cyril, the bishop of Alexandria. Rumors spread accusing her of preventing Orestes from reconciling with Cyril and, in March 415 AD, she was murdered by a mob of Christians led by a lector named Peter.\nWandering in the Umbra, you have found a spirit claiming to be her working at the head of the Umbra Mouseion.
