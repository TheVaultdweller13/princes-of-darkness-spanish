He managed to warn the Garou Nation that the White Howlers were lost before he died.\nAfter his death, he was unable to become an Ancestor Spirit, because the Tribal Homeland of the White Howlers had been transformed by Wyrm taint. He instead descended into the [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('shadowlands','Dark Umbra')], where he roamed as a wraith. Tortured by his memories, he barely staved off [UmbraGlossary('oblivion')], until a small pack of Black Spiral Dancers visited the [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('shadowlands','Dark Umbra')]. Coruroc tried to reason with them and, when his inquiries were met with mockery, extracted their souls from their bodies, turning them into wraiths themselves. He spent long years to purge them of their Wyrm taint and formed them into a small pack of his own. This pack now travels the [UmbraGlossary('shadowlands')], seeking to destroy the spirits of corrupted White Howler Kinfolk or convert (and, if necessary, destroy) other Black Spirals.\nAfter finding him, he offers a pact of mutual help if you can complete a quest."

Aristotle's later life was mired by his worsening relationship with his once pupil, Alexander. Forced to flee his home in Athens, his death was inglorious for such a revered monument of philosophical thought, which might have been the cause of his departure to Charon's realm after his death.\nInterested by the mortal world as most wraiths tend to be, you have easily convinced him to visit your court."

She was a prominent thinker in Alexandria where she taught philosophy and astronomy. She is the first female mathematician whose life is reasonably well recorded. Hypatia was renowned in her own lifetime as a great teacher and a wise counselor. She wrote a commentary on Diophantus's thirteen-volume Arithmetica, and another commentary on Apollonius of Perga's treatise on conic sections.\nAs an inventor, Hypatia constructed astrolabes and hydrometers. She was tolerant towards Christians and taught many Christian students, including Synesius, the future bishop of Ptolemais. Hypatia was widely beloved by pagans and Christians alike and she established great influence with the political elite in Alexandria. Towards the end of her life, Hypatia advised Orestes, the Roman prefect of Alexandria, who was in the midst of a political feud with Cyril, the bishop of Alexandria. Rumors spread accusing her of preventing Orestes from reconciling with Cyril and, in March 415 AD, she was murdered by a mob of Christians led by a lector named Peter.\nWandering in the [umbra|E], you have found a spirit claiming to be her working at the head of the [umbra|E] Mouseion.

These are the Muses, who were also known as apsaras in India or the Valkyrie in Nordic myth, but whose individual names and purviews were best divined by the ancient Greeks.\nThe Muses have a Court of their own upon a Spire whose base lies near the Mouseion in the Vulgate; this Spire resembles Mount Helicon in Greece, believed to be the home of the Muses in ancient times.\nOriginally there were nine Muses, in addition to the Elder Muses and their Leader; this number has doubled, but the original nine are still in existence, though their specialties and areas of influence have changed slightly. As the modes and means of human expression grew, so too did the variety of Muse. The original daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne have modernized their appearance and purviews somewhat.\nYour time in this court won't be infinite as the Elder Muses only tolerate guests for the amusement of their younger siblings.

Originally the Muse of Lyric Song, Euterpe has changed her purview to include all music save that produced by the human voice, which is Calliope’s domain.\nTerpsichore, Muse of the Dance. Terpsichore is, as she always has been, the Muse of Dancing, but has expanded her domain to include all those for whom the movement of the body is the central fact of their craft.\nArchiope, Muse of Architecture. A new Muse, Archiope’s purview is that of spatial enclosure and demarcation (usually permanent shelters, although tents and lean-tos also fall within her jurisdiction).\nTamaraponme, Muse of Dress. Another new Muse is Tamaraponme, whose domain includes all outward aspects of individual appearance and personal presentation.\nEudore, Muse of Drama. Eudore's purview is the physical projection of an intended character, whether one’s own, someone else’s or that of an entirely fictional person.\nPhidia, Muse of Sculpture. Once a mortal, Phidias’s skill at shaping stone so impressed the gods that he was invited to become the Muse of Sculpture.\nXerops, Muse of Painting.

She prefers happy endings, but may drive her filials through unending tribulations to get them there.\nMelpomene, Muse of Tragedy.Melpomene remains the Muse of Tragedy, for the pain that mortals inflict upon one another has changed but little over the last few thousand years. She does not delight in this pain, but tries to guide people through it into an understanding of why it has come about and what might be done to prevent it in the future.\nPolymnia, Muse of Religion. Polymnia was the Muse of sacred songs, and now lends her guidance to those on a spiritual path, who seek understanding of the mysteries of the soul.\nThalia, Muse of Comedy. Thalia was and remains the Muse of Comedy, always sensitive to the inherent absurdities of life, pointing out the humor of any situation.\nUrania, Muse of Science. Urania was the Muse of astronomy, and now extends her domain to all Science, ever on hand for those who seek to discover and comprehend.\nArchilochos, Muse of Action. Credited with being one of the first satiric poets on earth, Archilochos’s wit was wielded with such unyielding belligerence that he often had to defend his verse with actual combat. He has thus become the Muse of Action.\nSolon, Muse of Justice. Solon of Athens was identified with the moral conscience of the human race, emphasizing equality and fair play in the execution of the law, and so is now the Muse of Justice.\nPseudolos, Muse of Intrigue. Actually a fictional character from the works of Plautus, Pseudolos was given Umbral life as the Muse of Intrigue by all the scheming, plotting and dirty dealing that goes on in the world.\nLenore, Muse of Horror.

The ephemeral tangibility of these realms and their residents corresponds to matter in its solid state, maintaining a distinct shape and volume unless acted upon by external forces.\nThe journey is somewhat arduous but thanks to the previous thorough recon of the area, you manage to locate the target of your expedition, a strange suit of (obviously magical) armor.
