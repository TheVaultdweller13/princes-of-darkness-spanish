 PODadventurers.0003.desc: "The Visconti mortal family has been the centerpiece of Northern Italy politics for several generations now. They have produced many famous (and infamous) individuals as well as leaving their mark on the history of the region. They have stayed far away from the supernatural and avoided its interference... until now.\nOne scion of the family, Giangaleazzo, has recently been $pod_Embraced$ by an unknown Lasombra and has been quick to use both his family's gravitas and his shrewd political talent to gain a great influence in Lombardy in a surprising short amount of time. Previously trusted agents and loyal contacts have been turning against the local supernatural (and sometimes mortal) authorities to join his cause, seriously weakening the hold of the local rulers in this area."
 PODadventurers.0003.a: "Who does he think he is?"
 PODadventurers.0003.b: "Let us fight back his growing influence."

 PODadventurers.0005.desc: "In a surprising move, Giangaleazzo Visconti has come to your [ROOT.Char.Custom('PODDomicile')] in person. Being no fool, you quickly understand that he didn't come alone, being backed by his growing army in a show of force that you can only respect. The young Lasombra has apparently singled you out as the most influential vampire in Italy (though you think that he might just be telling that to every vampire rulers he encounters) and wants to discuss a potentially mutually beneficial arrangement.\nHe is willing to leave Italy with his army, causing no further distress in the region, if you agree to provide him with resources and funds so that he can start his rise to power somewhere else. To sweeten the deal, he even offers some of his Visconti contacts to help spread your influence in the region if you accept. "
 PODadventurers.0005.a: "We have a deal, Milanese."
 PODadventurers.0005.b: "Presumptuous upstart! Out of my sight!"

 PODadventurers.1001.desc: "Recent reports of your agents bring news of Giangaleazzo. This young vampire seems to have lofty ambitions and has gathered troops around northern Italy for an unknown purpose, tricking gullible mortal (and immortal) rulers into giving him more support for his growing army. So far, he has proven too clever and elusive to catch, which is in itself concerning..."
 PODadventurers.1001.a: "I have a bad feeling about this..."
 PODadventurers.1001.player_warning: "Be prepared, you will soon hear more about him."
 PODadventurers.1002.t: "The Prince: Giangaleazzo"
 PODadventurers.1002.desc: "#italic ‘I am not a man of passion. True, I consider Milan my birthright, since I was its duke a long time ago and, also true, Italy will always hold a special place in my cold heart. But did Caesar halt his ambitions to one city? One nation, even? I am not conquering lands and titles for a higher purpose or even for the thrill of it. Not at all. There are no religions, no philosophies and no emotions, there is only the Game. Outwitting your opponent, watching his plans crumble before he even knows your name, forcing him to betray everything he holds dear… That is the whole point of our existence. Remember, there is always a better player than you. Someone to watch, learn from, and then crush. And at the top of the Pyramid..? Well, I will see you there, provided you survive long enough.’ #!\nFollowing a meticulous gathering of intel and influence, Giangaleazzo has amassed a substantial army made of some of his old Condottieri contacts and disgruntled young vampires. He has already made progress on his campaign to conquer Northern Italy."

 PODadventurers.1011.desc: "The rebellion of Wat Tyler is raging across England, and he has started impacting the [cainite|E] world as well. Rumors of an acolyte among his turned vampires are growing, this acolyte being determined to start a more... nightly sort of rebellion."

 PODadventurers.1012.desc: "The rebellion of Wat Tyler has been an annoyance for English $pod_cainites$, but it appears that its ripple effects are just starting. One young Brujah, Patricia of Bollingbroke, has taken the name of the rebel and started rousing disillusioned young $pod_cainites$ and other rabble. The fiery woman seems bent on bringing an end to tyrants, be they mortals or otherwise. As she has taken her first city, and more are rallying to her side each passing night, the lords of England have a choice on how to deal with her. Will it be the velvet glove or the iron fist?"
 PODadventurers.1012.a: "Another rebel, another doomed failure soon to be crushed"

 PODadventurers.1012.b.custom: "Tyler will only bend the knee if you join her cause. A very insulting proposition to be sure, but you would also gain a powerful ally."

 PODadventurers.1022.t: "The Impaler: Vlad Tepes"
 PODadventurers.1022.desc: "The mortal ruler of Wallachia, Vlad Tepes Draculesti, has shown himself blessed with an indomitable will time and time again. He refused to be embraced on nothing but his own terms and knew much more about the Vampiric condition than many ancients even before turning into one. The first years of his unlife were ablaze with rumors. Who was his [Sire|E]? Had he truly found the Cathedral of Flesh and remained unscathed? Where lays his allegiance? These questions remain without answer, but the self styled Dracula seems to have had enough of wandering around. The Tzimisce, a mere youngling, has gathered an impressive host of vampires, ghouls and soldiers from his mortal time and finished his first conquest. Now he comes before you with an offer, acknowledge him as your protege and you could start a mutually beneficial relationship. Refuse and... well, the threat presented by such an individual doesn't need an explanation."

 PODadventurers.1022.b.custom: "Although it would be costly to acknowledge the threat posed by a mere youngling, having the famous Dracula as your adopted childe is a tempting offer. At the very least, it would probably buy you some time before he turns against you..."
