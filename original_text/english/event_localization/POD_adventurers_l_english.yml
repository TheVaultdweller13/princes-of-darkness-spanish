 PODadventurers.1001.t:0 "Trouble Ahead"
 PODadventurers.1001.desc:0 "Recent reports of your agents bring tales of a young neonate by the name of Giangaleazzo. This youngling seems to have lofty ambitions and, instead of showing you due respect as he should, he seems to be gathering support around northern Italy for an unknown purpose. So far, he has proven too clever and elusive to catch, which is in itself concerning..."
 PODadventurers.1001.a:0 "I have a bad feeling about this..."
 PODadventurers.1001.player_warning:0 "Be prepared, you will soon hear more about him."
 PODadventurers.1002.t:0 "The Prince : Giangaleazzo"
 PODadventurers.1002.desc:0 "‘I am not a man of passion. True, I consider Milan my birthright, since I was its duke a long time ago and, also true, Italy will always hold a special place in my cold heart. But did Caesar halt his ambitions to one city? One nation, even? I am not conquering lands and titles for a higher purpose or even for the thrill of it. Not at all. There are no religions, no philosophies and no emotions, there is only the Game. Outwitting your opponent, watching his plans crumble before he even knows your name, forcing him to betray everything he holds dear… That is the whole point of our existence. Remember, there is always a better player than you. Someone to watch, learn from, and then crush. And at the top of the Pyramid..? Well, I will see you there, provided you survive long enough.’"
 PODadventurers.1002.a:0 "Time to teach this arrogant Visconti some humility!"
 PODadventurers.1002.a.target.tt:0 "You will deal with him when the time comes"
 PODadventurers.1002.a.not_target.tt:0 "Your liege is now at war with Giangaleazzo"
 PODadventurers.1002.b:0 "I want this man on my side, whatever the cost!"
 PODadventurers.1002.b.custom:0 "You will vassalize the ambitious Visconti. It will cost you a lot to pull off and he will be grateful only for a time..." 
 POD_giangaleazzo.notification:0 "The Prince makes his move"
 POD_giangaleazzo.desc:0 "In Italy, Giangaleazzo Visconti, an ambitious Lasombra, has launched a campaign of conquest. Will he shake the old center of the Empire?"
 PODadventurers.1011.t:0 "Trouble Ahead"
 PODadventurers.1011.desc:0 "The rebellion of Wat Tyler is raging across England, and he has started impacting the [cainite|E] world as well. Rumors of an acolyte among his turned vampires are growing, this acolyte being determined to start a more... nightly sort of rebellion." 
 PODadventurers.1011.a:0 "I have a bad feeling about this..."
 PODadventurers.1011.player_warning:0 "Be prepared, you will soon hear more about this."
 PODadventurers.1012.t:0 "The Rebel : Tyler"
 PODadventurers.1012.desc:0 "The rebellion of Wat Tyler has been an annoyance for English [cainites|E], but it appears that its ripple effects are just starting. One young Brujah, Patricia of Bollingbroke, has taken the name of the rebel and started rousing disillusioned young [cainites|E] and other rabble. The fiery woman seems bent on bringing an end to tyrants, be they mortals or otherwise. As she has taken her first city, and more are rallying to her side each passing night, the lords of England have a choice on how to deal with her. Will it be the velvet glove or the iron fist?"
 PODadventurers.1012.a:0 "Another rebel, another doomed failure soon to be crushed"
 PODadventurers.1012.a.target.tt:0 "You will deal with her when the time comes"
 PODadventurers.1012.a.not_target.tt:0 "Your liege is now at war with Tyler"
 PODadventurers.1012.b:0 "Well.. she has some good points... and a big army"
 PODadventurers.1012.b.custom:0 "Tyler will only bend the knee if you join her cause. A very insulting proposition to be sure, but you would also gain a powerful ally." 
 PODadventurers.1012.c:0 "We are on the same side!"
 POD_tyler.notification:0 "The Rebel makes her move"
 POD_tyler.desc:0 "In England, Patricia of Bollingbroke rises up against tyrants in a probably doomed attempt at freedom... or is it the first true spark of a great revolution?"
 PODadventurers.1021.t:0 "Trouble Ahead"
 PODadventurers.1021.desc:0 "Rumors have reached you that Vlad Tepes, the already famous ruler of Wallachia, has made inquiries about the [cainite|E] world. Somehow, he has learned about your kind's existence and seems interested in it." 
 PODadventurers.1021.a:0 "I have a bad feeling about this..."
 PODadventurers.1021.player_warning:0 "Be prepared, you will soon hear more about this."
 PODadventurers.1022.t:0 "The Impaler : Vlad Tepes"
 PODadventurers.1022.desc:0 "The mortal ruler of Wallachia, Vlad Tepes Draculesti, has shown himself blessed with an indomitable will time and time again. He refused to be embraced on nothing but his own terms and knew much more about the Vampiric condition than many ancients even before turning into one. The first years of his unlife were ablaze with rumors. Who was his [Sire|E]? Had he truly found the Cathedral of Flesh and remained unscathed? Where lays his allegiance? These questions remain without answer, but the self styled Dracula seems to have had enough of wandering around. The Tzimisce, a mere youngling, has gathered an impressive host of vampires, ghouls and soldiers from his mortal time and finished his first conquest. Now he comes before you with an offer, acknowledge him as your protege and you could start a mutually beneficial relationship. Refuse and... well, the threat presented by such an individual doesn't need an explanation."
 PODadventurers.1022.a:0 "An upstart is still an upstart, even with a fancy nickname"
 PODadventurers.1022.a.target.tt:0 "You will deal with him when the time comes"
 PODadventurers.1022.a.not_target.tt:0 "Your liege is now at war with Dracula"
 PODadventurers.1022.b:0 "An offer I can't refuse"
 PODadventurers.1022.b.custom:0 "Although it would be costly to acknowledge the threat posed by a mere youngling, having the famous Dracula as your adopted childe is a tempting offer. At the very least, it would probably buy you some time before he turns against you..." 
 POD_vlad.notification:0 "The Impaler makes his move"
 POD_vlad.desc:0 "In Transylvania, Vlad Tepes continues his bloody career, this time as an undead. A new Lord of the Night for the land beyond the forest?"
