 POD_maintenance.18.t: "Imperial Ambition"

While your word alone certainly carries great weight, you can't be everywhere at once and, as you expand, must rely more and more on subordinates and can starts to draw the concerned attention of your fellow powerful rulers. On the contrary, a smaller realm tends to be less powerful but more efficient, extracting more from each of its members.\nYour current overextension level has changed, meaning some parts of your internal bureaucracy will have to be reorganized."

 POD_maintenance.21.desc: "As the World of Darkness follows its course in the shadows, the mortals do not wait. Entering a new era is a moment of both wonder and dread. Mortals have proved time and time again their capacity to surprise the often jaded and set in their ways supernatural creatures of the world. As they reach for their potential, influencing them become more difficult and costly and creatures who were once a reality pass on to the realm of myths.\n\n#X Each era increases the cost of buildings, mercenaries and reduce the efficiency of bygone creatures. These effects can be reviewed in the innovations culture screen if you hover over the eras.#!"
 POD_maintenance.21.a: "Let us review our situation."

 POD_maintenance.24.desc: "Once, Constantinople dreamed it was Heaven. Then it fell, and imagined it was Hell. Tonight, it wakes up and takes its place beside its earthly brethren. Cainites who spent centuries carried on the wings of Michael the Patriarch’s daydream recover now from their crash landing and look for a future amidst the rubble.\nFor the childer of Caine, two Constantinoples rise behind nigh-impregnable walls. The fabled wonderland that bestows riches, influence, and mystical might upon the worthy is the Megalopolis of the Dream, a flame, the embers of which refuse to fully die. But the sobering reality is that of a decadent fallen utopia where blood and sharks mingle in the water and faith struggles for expression.\nThe city — #italic the city #! to so many — toils to recover day by day, but wonders and terrors escape through the cracks between its rulers fingers.\nIt is time for the once glorious city to reinvent itself or be washed away by the sands of history."
 POD_maintenance.24.a: "Dreams truly die it seems."

 POD_maintenance.25.t: "Dreaming Anew"
 POD_maintenance.25.desc: "Byzantium has changed hands many times since its humble beginnings as a trading village. Each mortal culture who occupied this place made its own mark on the history of the city and today is no different. With your recent change of outlook, you could encourage another turn of the wheel for Constantinople, promoting your new goals on its inhabitants. Of course, you could also simply let history continue its course unaltered.\n #N Choosing to change will reset Constantinople to a new type of Grand City, removing your current buildings in the process.#!"
 POD_maintenance.25.a: "I won't interfere."
 POD_maintenance.25.b: "Time to change."
