 POD_blackdeath.0002.t:0 "Rumors of a Plague"
 POD_blackdeath.0002.desc:0 "Diseases are a given of this day and age but a nascent rumor has given you pause. It speaks of a plague more terrible than any others, coming from the far east. This terrible infection seems to spread at an alarming rate and the death toll is climbing every day.\nYour rule, while somewhat detached from mortal concerns, is still very much tied to the well being of those fragile beings in your realm. What would happen if you were suddenly the ruler of nothing but corpses and fleas? This is a grim prospect, enough to give even the most cruel lord something to think about.\nTime is running short however, and you have to make a decision, will you try to subtly prepare the mortals in your area for the troubled times ahead?"
 POD_blackdeath.0002.a:0 "Let us pray for salvation!"
 POD_blackdeath.0002.b:0 "I need my mortals healthy!"
 POD_blackdeath.0002.c:0 "That's far below my concern"
 POD_blackdeath_preparations:0 "You will be more prepared when the pale rider arrives."

 #high_blackdeath_devastation_modifier_desc:0 "The Pale Rider is here. This is his realm, and no living soul can enter here anymore."
 POD_blackdeath.0004.t:0 "The Black Death"
 POD_blackdeath.0004.desc:0 "The world has known its fair share of plagues and diseases, but has it ever known something as deadly as this Black Death? Even with your great knowledge, you don't recall an event as dire as this one.\nMortals are dying in drove, claimed by the Pale Rider who moves on from city to city, leaving only corpses and fleas in his wake. Prayers, fire, blame... nothing seems to be able to stop it, or even slow it. Entire communities have been reduced to ashes and the eerie silence permeating the air day and night is telling...\nIs this the end?"
 POD_blackdeath.0004.a:0 "A slow, grueling end to humankind?"
 POD_blackdeath_happening:0 "The Black Death has come. Realms have been devastated, losing development and buildings depending on the scale of the infection. You will see a county modifier indicating the amount of damage done on each county."
 POD_blackdeath.0005.t:0 "The Scourge"
 POD_blackdeath.0005.desc:0 "It's getting worse.\nSomehow, the Black Death strain seems to have mutated. So far, it only affected mortals and carried little direct consequences for vampires but this isn't the case anymore. This variant, dubbed 'the Scourge' by scholars, directly attacks the vampire's vitae. It makes the blood less powerful than it otherwise is, and as such requires greater expenditure to actually works. Combined with the limited blood supply due to the mortals still dying left and right with the Black Death...\nThe only good news is that the Scourge doesn't seem lethal to vampires, only debilitating at most. Despite frantic inquiries, nobody has the starting clue on how this could have happened or if someone is responsible for it..."
 POD_blackdeath.0005.a:0 "Is there an end to this nightmare?"
 POD_blackdeath.0005.b:0 "The Tremere are to blame for sure!"
 POD_blackdeath.0005.c:0 "The Cappadocians have meddled with the dead mortals corpses!"
 POD_blackdeath.0005.d:0 "It's obviously the Setites' fault."
 POD_scourge_tremere:0 "The Tremere in your realm won't like that."
 POD_scourge_cappadocian:0 "The Cappadocians in your realm won't like that."
 POD_scourge_setite:0 "The Setites in your realm won't like that."
 POD_scourge_warning:0 "Some vampires have started getting infected by the Scourge and spreading it."
 weak_scourge_modifier:0 "Small Scourge Symptoms"
 weak_scourge_modifier_desc:0 "You have been infected by the Scourge. Luckily, you are only experiencing some mild weakness so far."
 medium_scourge_modifier:0 "Medium Scourge Symptoms"
 medium_scourge_modifier_desc:0 "You have been infected by the Scourge. You are severely weakened, and have trouble keeping the appearance of a strong ruler."
 high_scourge_modifier:0 "Severe Scourge Symptoms"
 high_scourge_modifier_desc:0 "You have been infected by the Scourge. You feel very weak and, worse, you appear very weak to the rest of the Cainite world."
 POD_blackdeath.0007.t:0 "The Scourge : Infected!"
 POD_blackdeath.0007.desc:0 "The Scourge spares no one... at least not you. It's a strange feeling really, sickness has been a faint memory of your breathing days for a long time at this point and now it's back to haunt you.\nYou feel weak, your blood has trouble conjuring the power it once had and you can see in the eyes of your entourage the fear of being exposed to you... and the greedy glint of opportunities being pondered while you are thus weakened.\nTroubled times ahead."
 POD_blackdeath.0007.a:0 "I just need to lay down a little..."
 POD_scourge_happening:0 "You have been infected by the Scourge. With the infectious nature of the disease, your entourage is or will soon be as well probably.\nYou can check the severity of your current state as a character modifier."
 POD_blackdeath.0008.t:0 "The End of a Nightmare?"
 POD_blackdeath.0008.desc:0 "The Black Death is slowly losing ground on the mortal realm. And while an utterly devastating event, it hasn't wiped out humanity as some have feared. It will take a long time for civilization to come back to where it was before, but the rebuilding efforts have begun.\nThe Scourge, this vampiric disease that affected them, is also slowing down, probably due to its parasitic connection to the Black Death itself. It seems the doomed race of Caine has earned a little more time under the night sky."
 POD_blackdeath.0008.a:0 "The Pale Rider has shown mercy."
