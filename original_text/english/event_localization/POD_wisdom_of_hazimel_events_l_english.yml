 POD_hazimel_wisdom.001.t: "Seeking Wisdom"
 POD_hazimel_wisdom.001.desc: "The great Hazimel paid a price for his wisdom: his eye. His example is still followed by some Ravnos to this night, as no one can achieve greatness without sacrifices.\nNot every kindred is ready to sacrifice a part of their immortal body to achieve knowledge. You, unlike others, are ready to do so. Only the brave might achieve eternal wisdom, but are you strong enough to make a sacrifice with no turning back?"
 POD_hazimel_wisdom.001.option.a: "I will follow Hazimel's example. An eye in exchange for knowledge"
 POD_hazimel_wisdom.001.option.a.tt: "You will lose your eye, and you won't be able to heal it back"
 POD_hazimel_wisdom.001.option.b: "My leg can't compare to the knowledge I will get!"
 POD_hazimel_wisdom.001.option.b.tt: "You will lose your leg, and you won't be able to heal it back"
 POD_hazimel_wisdom.001.option.c: "I... I am not ready"
 POD_hazimel_wisdom.001.option.c.tt: "You will abandon your quest for wisdom"
