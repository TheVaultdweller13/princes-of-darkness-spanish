POD_hazimel_wisdom.001.desc:0 "The great Hazimel paid a price for his wisdom : his eye. His example is still followed by some Ravnos to this night, as no one can achieve greatness without sacrifices.\nNot every kindred is ready to sacrifice a part of their immortal body to achieve knowledge. You, unlike others, are ready to do so. Only the brave might achieve eternal wisdom, but are you strong enough to make a sacrifice with no turning back?"
POD_hazimel_wisdom.001.option.a:0 "I will follow Hazimel's example. An eye in exchange for knowledge"
POD_hazimel_wisdom.001.option.a.tt:0 "You will lose your eye, and you won't be able to heal it back"
POD_hazimel_wisdom.001.option.b:0 "My leg can't compare to the knowledge I will get!"
POD_hazimel_wisdom.001.option.b.tt:0 "You will lose your leg, and you won't be able to heal it back"
POD_hazimel_wisdom.001.option.c:0 "I... I am not ready"
POD_hazimel_wisdom.001.option.c.tt:0 "You will abandon your quest for wisdom"
