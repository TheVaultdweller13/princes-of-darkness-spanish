 POD_werewolf_teaser.100.desc: "While you are out hunting, you suddenly spy a nine-foot tall wolf standing on its hind legs! It does not see you quite yet.  What do you do?"
 POD_werewolf_teaser.100.option.a: "Run away!"
 POD_werewolf_teaser.100.option.a.tt: "Is this anyway to experience new content that players have been begging for since the mod was first launched?"

 POD_werewolf_teaser.300.desc: "You have beaten the lupine and taken its blood! What a fearsome beast that was. You can not help but wonder how many more roam these lands and if you will see them in the future.\n\nIn the distance, you hear the howls of a pack of wolves."

 POD_werewolf_teaser.300.option.a.tt: "A full new splat is going to take time. When we fully release playable werewolf characters, we want it to have at least the depth and complexity of the addition of hunters to the mod; with game mechanics that bring a different style of play. If you have ideas about how we should create werewolves in Princes of Darkness Mod, now is the time to tell us. Jump on our Discord and let us know!"

Your last moments locked in combat with this awesome and terrible creature. Are there many more like it?\n\nIn the distance, you hear the howls of a pack of wolves.\n\nThe lupine then tears your head from your body."
