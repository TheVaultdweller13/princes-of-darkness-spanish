 podintroductions1500.10.desc:0 "The Inquisition started and was at its peak in France, and the [cainite|E] political structure has suffered quite a lot from it. Salianna and Esclarmonde have both been betrayed and ousted by the ruthless Beatrix who now rules the Courts of Love with the pivotal help of her two champions : Francois Villon and Eon de l'Etoile.\nWhile her ascension was quick and showed a keen political mind, it wasn't enough to avoid the ambitious Isouda's attempted coup however, and France was then divided between the two queens. The birth of the sects changed little to this state of affairs, Beatrix joining the Camarilla and Isouda the Sabbat, and it seems that the ideological battle takes a backseat to the ambitions of the last Queens of Love.\nFrance has a long way to go before finally achieving stability once more."

 podintroductions1500.11.desc:0 "Since his return after the Norman invasion of 1066, Mithras has once again secured his hold over England. With his rivals undermined and his cult on the rise, the God King was looking outwards... until the Black Plague, the inquisition and the Anarch Revolt all happened in close succession.\nIt took several decades to deal with these issues that Mithras blamed on the Tremere, which he quickly expelled from his island. Victorious once again, Mithras was then taken by surprise when that annoying Hardestadt secured a major diplomatic victory by creating the Camarilla. Feeling that such a momentous occasion should have been his to lead, Mithras is since then weighting his options. Joining the Camarilla would be the logical choice, but taking an alternate path would wipe off the smug smile on that infuriating German's face, which is something sounding quite attractive to the master of England..."

Still, not everything is peaceful under the Black Cross, Hardestadt's callous treatment of his charismatic childe Jürgen von Verden led to widespread rebellion in his old followers' ranks, led by Lucretia von Hardtz.\nThe founder of the Camarilla has now lost much of his power in Eastern Germany, where the remnants of the Anarch Revolt, Jürgen's vengeful followers and other petty warlords gather with only one thing in common : an undying hatred for the new self proclaimed most important [cainite|E] of the undead world."

To these rumors, Moncada only answers with a smile and a blessing before returning to his enigmatic goal.\nIt seems unlikely that the small enclaves of independent Iberian powers will be able to withstand Moncada's disciplined troops of fanatical believers for much longer. Blessed by God or not, Iberia has only one master for the time being."

Ruling his realm like an extended family with a strong focus on the duties and rights of the Sicilian people, this strange independent has enjoyed a large amount of success so far.\nGratiano and Giangaleazzo are nominally allied to one another, making the Sabbat the most likely winner for Italy.

While this effort targeted Alamut and the Children of Haqim, it has also broken the stability of the region, especially since many of the attackers stayed in Mesopotamia under the leadership of Menele himself.\nHelped by this upheaval, another insidious threat emerged.

Still, the path to victory won't exactly be easy as the second major Wan Kuei court, the Infinite Thunder, is still strong and poised to counter the Ravnos's advance at every step.\nIndia's fate might have finally shifted, but it is too soon to call a victor yet."

Elaine de Calinot, a powerful Tremere sorceress, suddenly seized control of Algiers and started expanding outwards looking for... something (or someone?) with a disturbing single mindedness.

The warriors of the clan had already been striking against the Kindred of the West during the years of the Anarch Revolt, largely in retribution for the Crusades, seen by many in the clan as a gambit of the Jyhad they had long sought to avoid.\nThe Blood Hunt can be attributed in large part to the Great Lie of the Tremere elder Etrius, who painted the Children of Haqim as nothing more than vicious killers and diablerists. Once the Blood Hunt was called, the beleaguered [Clan|E] fought all the harder, and especially after the Convention of Thorns when their Anarch allies were lured back into the fold of the Camarilla.
