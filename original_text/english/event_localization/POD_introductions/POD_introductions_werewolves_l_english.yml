 podintroductionswerewolves.2.t: "Praise the Sun!"
 podintroductionswerewolves.2.desc: "The Sept of the Sun's Glory is perhaps the strongest werewolf outpost surviving in Western Europe after the devastating Flaying Plague. Still, the succession of its founder hasn't been without trouble and it's an unlikely outsider, Helen of the Black Furies, who has ascended as leader of the Caern.\nStill, that was the easy part. The neighboring vampires have been quick to pounce on the weakened Sept and have taken most of its southern territory. If Helen is to be remembered as a legend on her own right, she will have to quickly secure her surroundings before the powerful nearby vampires, and inquisitors, go for the coup de grace."
 podintroductionswerewolves.2.a: "We will forge our glory anew."
 podintroductionswerewolves.3.t: "Hanging by a Thread"
 podintroductionswerewolves.3.desc: "The werewolves presence in Iberia is almost gone. The once powerful Sept of the Fields of Stars has been devastated in a costly war against the neighboring Order of St-James and, when the dust settled, the only winners were the vampires. With most of its leaders and warriors dead, the Sept was as good as destroyed until a strange outsider, Lucille of the Bone Gnawers, appeared.\nThis crafty trickster managed to confound the leeches and the inquisitors in convoluted schemes long enough for the Fields of Stars to recover a little. To everyone's surprise, even maybe hers, she became the de facto ruler of the beleaguered survivors. Still, even with those small victories, her position is almost desperate. Will her tricks and guile be enough to save the Iberian Garou?"
 podintroductionswerewolves.3.a: "Survival against all odds?"
 podintroductionswerewolves.4.t: "The Day After"
 podintroductionswerewolves.4.desc: "All around Scandinavia, the Get of Fenris shout their recent victory against the hated Wotan, also known as Odin. But even they know that this victory costed them way more than they could afford. With their best warriors and warleaders dead and gone, an unproven leader has risen and Odin's get is quickly rallying to the South to avenge their accursed God.\nFurther East, the Children of Gaia of the Sept of the White Sea observe the situation, concerned that this war might soon engulf them as well. Should they find new friends in nearby Russia or put their full support behind the desperate war fought by the Get of Fenris? Their answer might change the fate of the Scandinavian werewolves."
 podintroductionswerewolves.4.a: "Doesn't taste like victory"
 podintroductionswerewolves.5.t: "The Celts' Last Stand"
 podintroductionswerewolves.5.desc: "Always a strong force in the British Isles, the Fianna Tribe has been decimated by the Flaying Plague, leaving them wide open to the powerful vampire known as Mithras. Barely hanging on in Wales, they have regrouped in the Caern of the Wild Sea under the leadership of King Bladdud, a proven and charismatic leader.\nDespite the respect he inspires, many are wondering if even he can do something about this desperate situation. Perhaps the time of the Celts is truly over? Or maybe this will be the start of the greatest story to come from the Fianna, the one of their glorious reconquest of their home?"
 podintroductionswerewolves.5.a: "At least, it will be a story worth telling"
 podintroductionswerewolves.6.t: "Land of the Wolves"
 podintroductionswerewolves.6.desc: "Russia and the Steppes are still an untamed land and the werewolves are in a strong position here. From the powerful Sept of the Crescent Moon, Yuri Tvarivich rules the Silver Fangs and is an exemplar of his tribe. His exploits against the accursed Shadow Curtain of Baba Yaga are already legendary.\nFurther east, the Red Talons have retreated to the Caern of the Winter Forest to lick their wounds as they have been hurt quite badly by the Flaying Plague.\nFinally, in the south, the Shadow Lords still wage their eternal war against the Tzimisce. Also weakened by the Flaying Plague, they have been put on the back foot, but could profit from the ongoing Tzimisce/Tremere war to recover from their territorial losses."
 podintroductionswerewolves.6.a: "If only we could unite..."
 podintroductionswerewolves.7.t: "Crusader Wolves"
 podintroductionswerewolves.7.desc: "Acre is the land of the Warder of Men, this peculiar tribe that feel at home among humans in their cities. That doesn't make them any less of a werewolf than the others though, as the recent ruthless war for leadership over the Caern of the Bright Promise shows. As the dust settled, it's the lady of Outremer, Isabeau du Laurent, who stands as Alpha for now.\nPreoccupied with this internal conflict, the Warder were oblivious to the growing threat presented by the vampires in the region. This threat, if not dealt with swiftly and decisively, could spell doom for the city wolves."
 podintroductionswerewolves.7.a: "A Bright Promise shattered?"
 podintroductionswerewolves.8.t: "Far from Egypt"
 podintroductionswerewolves.8.desc: "Since their defeat against the hated Egyptian 'god' Set, the Silent Striders have been on the run behind their immortal ruler, the wise Wepauwet. Following auspicious signs and prophecies, they have discovered the Wheel of Ptah near Marrakesh and have been busy claiming the surrounding area for themselves since then.\nThe Striders are few and not the most warlike of the Garou but with a sense of renewed purpose and the patient leadership of their revered Alpha, they are finally finding hope again. Some are even dreaming of seeing Egypt again one day..."
 podintroductionswerewolves.8.a: "A new hope"
 podintroductionswerewolves.9.t: "The Top of the World"
 podintroductionswerewolves.9.desc: "Far from the rest of the Garou nation, the small Stargazer tribe has been prospering in the Himalayas. Contemplative and patient by nature, they have been content living their lives in relative peace. Still, this current state couldn't last forever.\nThe recent attack by a powerful evil spirit has been seen as an omen by the wise Chakal. If the Stargazers stay isolated and refuse any contact with the outside world, only doom awaits them. With a sense of mixed dread and curiosity, the Stargazers are now looking outwards for the first time in centuries. What awaits them?"
 podintroductionswerewolves.9.a: "A whole world to explore"

 podintroductionswerewolves.100.d: "I'm good, let's go!"
 podintroductionswerewolves.103.t: "Time to Rage"
 podintroductionswerewolves.103.desc: "Werewolves have several keys differences from other characters. First, they live in tribal holdings and mostly don't care, or actively want to lower, development to access their buildings. Those buildings cost prestige, as do most things in werewolves society and mechanics.\nWhile very strong fighters and quite enduring, werewolves are completely mortal and must plan for their succession accordingly. Each werewolf has a 'breed' (describing who he was before his First Change) and an 'auspice' (describing under which Full Moon this First Change occurred). These two determine which special lifestyles are available to each individual werewolf. They gain experience in those by going on spiritual quests, a minor decision.\nFinally, take notice that all werewolves have access to raiding, regardless of their religion."
 podintroductionswerewolves.103.a: "What about succession?"
 podintroductionswerewolves.103.c: "Lore of the Tribes" 
 podintroductionswerewolves.103.h: "Back to the beginning"
 podintroductionswerewolves.104.t: "Moonlight Love"
 podintroductionswerewolves.104.desc: "Werewolves have companions and families that are named 'Kinfolk' (a trait in the mod). Any children born of a werewolf, kinfolk (or a combination of both) will be born a kinfolk as well. Then, there is a chance that this kinfolk will go through the First Change sometimes during puberty.\nThis experience is the first time that a kinfolk becomes a werewolf (in game terms, the kinfolk trait is replaced by the werewolf one). If your heir happens to be a kinfolk (and doesn't experience the First Change), this will weaken your realm considerably as some buildings will be disabled and you will lose access to the special lifestyles. While this will be crippling, you might still recover down the line with another werewolf generation if you planned ahead for this occurrence."

 podintroductionswerewolves.105.desc: "The [world_of_darkness|E] is an universe running for more than 30 years now, with hundred of books and other medias covering it. The main idea is that, in our world, several factions of supernaturals creatures are interacting below the surface, creating an underworld full of intrigues and stories.\nYou are playing Dark Ages: Werewolves. Werewolves (or Garou) are the champions of Gaia (the spirit of the Earth). Prone to anger and rash action, they are nonetheless brave and diligent in their task. Garou are divided by Tribes, each one having its own culture and separate characteristics. Together, they form the 'Garou Nation'.\nIn 1230 however, the unity of the Nation is an illusion at best. Discord between the tribes, combined with the devastating Flaying Plague and the growth of human civilizations have left the werewolves severely weakened and retreating to their dwindling forests.\nIf decisive action is not taken soon to recover some of the lost ground, Gaia's champions might soon become nothing more than a legend."

Once this is done, you get access to a [journey|E] allowing you to train your pack, resulting in various improvements for yourself and your teammates.\nOnce your pack is full (yourself and four other members), you can choose a Pack Totem to bless your team, representing a powerful spirit giving you their strength for the trials ahead."

 podintroductionswerewolves.303.desc: "Bastet have several keys differences from other characters. First, they live in tribal holdings and mostly don't care, or actively want to lower, development to access their buildings. Those buildings cost prestige, some also require specific court positions to be occupied by skilled characters.\nWhile strong fighters and quite enduring, Bastet are completely mortal and must plan for their succession accordingly. Each werecat has a 'breed' (describing who he was before his First Change). These determine which special lifestyles are available to each individual Bastet.\nBastet (except the Swara) are less comfortable around the [umbra|E] than werewolves and must attain rank 2 of their trait before being able to access it.\nFinally, take notice that all Bastet have access to raiding, regardless of their religion."
 podintroductionswerewolves.304.desc: "Bastet have companions and families that are named 'Kinfolk' (a trait in the mod).

Together, they form the 'Bastet Nation'.\nIn 1230 however, the unity of the Nation is an illusion at best. After their defeat during the War of Rage against the werewolves, the Bastet only prospered in areas where wolves weren't present, mainly Africa and India. Most tribes now don't have contact with each other, some even being thought long dead. It will take a lot of effort and a skilled champion if the Bastet are to become united and strong once more."
