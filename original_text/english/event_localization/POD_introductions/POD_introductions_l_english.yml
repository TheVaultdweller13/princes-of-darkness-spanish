 podintroductions.2003.desc: "The first thing to note is that, as a $POD_splat_vampire$, you are immortal... sort of. You won't die of old age or disease, but being put to the torch or decapitated will still end your unlife. As such, succession is a lesser, but still present, concern for you. In the same vein, Marriages can't produce children, so they are mostly a political tool available to a select few religions. \nReligions are a core part of the gameplay, even more than in CK3. Here, it represents the core philosophical tenets of your character, which help him not fall to the Beast. Indeed, the Beast -a literal manifestation of your inner monstrosity- is one of your worst foes, and managing your stress is paramount to not fall prey to it, as it would mean your character has become a feral wight, resulting in his abdication.\nTake notice of your hunger, a core modifier representing your need for blood. Hunger is used for many schemes and powers, and replenish slowly or with active hunting."
 podintroductions.2003.desc_ghouls: "Firstly, it is recommended to only play $POD_splat_ghoul_plural$ and $POD_splat_revenant_plural$ after you have a good grasp of $POD_splat_vampire$ mechanics, as they both use similar ones, but with less possibilities and more difficulties for the 'servants of darkness'. This intro will only talk about specific changes from the mainline vampire mechanics.\nGhouls are immortals but $pod_revenants$ aren't, their lifespan is greatly improved over mortal humans however. Both can have children, which are likely to become $pod_revenants$ (more so if from a [revenant|E] couple).\nThey got access to special buildings which are quite powerful, but lack access to some of the more specific vampire ones.\nThey can use $pod_disciplines$ in the same lifestyle way as vampires. There are no [Embrace|E], [diablerie|E] schemes and the like available to them.\nKeep in mind that, while unnaturally healthy, you aren't immune to diseases like vampires are.\nFinally, remember that this is a substantially harder gameplay style, since you basically are a weaker vampire with few advantages, less mechanics and a lot of new drawbacks."

You can instead choose to invest your time into the $pod_disciplines$, opening the powers of the damned for your use.\nBuildings represent your influence over the mortal populace. Most are capped by a stat like control and you will have to choose how to balance these. Note that major centers of populations, represented by high development duchy capitals are the biggest asset any Prince can dream of.\nWarfare is sensibly altered, with a bigger emphasis on knights. The prowess of your knights can easily overcome a much more numerous foe, especially if mostly composed of levies. As such, be very wary of high prowess hostile Vampires.\nIn a world full of deceit and tricks, intrigue plays a bigger role. There are new schemes to discover, some linked to your powers, and most of the characters have secrets better left untold... or used for blackmail if their religion allows it."

This dynasty tree of the undeath has branched into several factions, the clans, each with its strength, weakness and geographical power base.\nIn Dark Ages: Vampires, which you are playing now, we are following the undead world at the crossroad of several major crisis.

To address these new threats, the Camarilla has been formed by the majority of the $pod_Clans$, a sect aiming at hiding vampires from mortal eyes. The opposition to this has coalesced into the formation of the Sabbat, vampires revealing in their monstrous nature. Many $pod_masquerade_exposure_with_icon$ haven't picked a side though, and the future of these two fragile sects remain quite uncertain at this point."

They are the original Immortals of Egypt, the land of black sand and pyramids. Bound together by their shared culture, they continue to work towards Horus's twin goals: vengeance against Set and the defeat of the serpent Apophis.\nNot all Mummies are committed to this fight however. Some instead have chosen to go their separate way despite Horus' disapproval, those have became known as Ishmaelites.\nOne of those 'neutral' Mummies then taught the Spell of Life to Cabirus, a Greek Mage, who founded his own 'dynasty' still hunted to this day by Horus who isn't happy at all about the sacred Spell of Life being given to unbelievers.\nFinally, Set himself never acquired the true Spell of Life but he got close to it, enough so that he created his own twisted version of it.

Dana herself created us. They’re probably all true in their own way. The [mythic_age|E] was just that… mythic. A story changes with the telling and so does our past. The past is reflected in the Now, and time is fluid. Cave paintings were magical. They fixed an event in time. Before that, history had nothing to bind it. It was based on what the storyteller believed, or rather, what they chose to say. That’s magic, too."

 podintroductions.2505.desc: "Since the Sundering’s beginning, the world’s connection with the [UmbraGlossary('dreaming')] was slowly wavering. Then, the world changed for the worse. As Banality grew stronger, the fae grew weaker. The cycles of our lives were gradually but inexorably spinning into new courses, and some among the Unseelie Court were determined to do something to draw the Dreaming back to them. They believed that plunging the world into chaos would lessen Banality and make mortals more tractable. After all, they’re more likely to believe in dragons if they see one flatten their house. These dark fae refused the Seelie their ascendance during the light half of the year, and so the mad struggle began. Shocked by this unheard-of breach in tradition, many fae fell into their own Unseelie natures. Bitter winds and cold rains the dark ones brought to bear against a cowering world; dragons and drakes and great wyrms were wakened from centuries-long slumber to once more make the earth wither beneath the shadow of their wings.\nIn the early years of the thirteenth century, the winters grew long and cold and the rains fell with monsoon-like duration. Crops drowned. Roads were reduced to muddy morasses. Famine and cold did their part to fill the graveyards. Warfare’s destruction was pegged on Mongols or squabbles between local kings instead of the Shining Host and nightmares made real. Killing the Dreamers was madness; starving and hopeless peasants cannot dream, and an artist in a hungry land cannot find patronage. Even worse, in such chaos, people looked to the Church, whose hate of the fae was growing. And still the battles raged."

The main things to look for are stats, the higher advantage you have over the target in one category, the easier it will be.\nFind Lair is also a good preparation for a difficult war, as you can hunt down your future foe's best knights before the war even starts."
