 PODcanon_chars.1.t: "New Beginnings"
 PODcanon_chars.1.desc: "It is finally done. The fool, Menele of Sparta, is dead and you are, for the first time in millennia, free to do as you wish. The victory feels more... hollow than you would have thought, as you suddenly lost what has been your purpose in unlife... but you will move on, as you always do.\nThe world has forgotten you, and even the oldest Toreador think you a myth at this point. This might play to your advantage. It is time to return to the world of [cainite|E] politics, a world you know so well, but with a distinct advantage: nobody important is even truly suspicious of your true powers.\nThis is an asset that will prove very useful, and that you intent to keep for as long as possible..."

 PODcanon_chars.2.desc: "It is finally done. You have nearly completed the ritual to invoke Svantevit into a willing host. You can't wait to feel the power of a God flowing through your undying veins!\nThere is a small issue though, during your research, you found that the host's mind is supposed to be wiped out by Svantevit's arrival. Obviously, you are of strong will and wouldn't give up as easily as some of the idiots cultists you crushed but... this is still concerning.\nSimply deciphering the ritual already taught you a lot, and might be a sufficient reward in itself.\nOr you could summon a God and try to bend it to your will. The choice is yours... perhaps for the last time."
 PODcanon_chars.2.a: "Ultimate Power!"
 PODcanon_chars.2.b: "...I'm not feeling it"
 PODcanon_chars.3.t: "Romance of the Gods"
 PODcanon_chars.3.desc: "She is back.\nThe beloved daughter of Isis has joined your side again, and a flurry of conflicting emotions rushes back to you. What you had this one time was passionate, if fleeting. Perhaps your story will endure the test of time better now that you are both older and, hopefully, wiser.\nAt the very least, it will be interesting, especially as your vassals are already grumbling behind your back. Kemintiri never was the most popular figure among them.\nBut you don't care. She is back and the unlife seems worth living again, hopefully for a long while."
 PODcanon_chars.3.a: "Let us remake this land in our image"
 PODcanon_chars.mithras: "You have unlocked a new timed major decision"
 PODcanon_chars.4.t: "Trial by War"
 PODcanon_chars.4.desc: "You have planned a succession of quick and decisive skirmishes against this rebellious vassal of yours. If you manage to achieve victory, you will be safe from rebellion, from this one at least, for a while.\nBetter be sure before launching the attack though, if you lose, the consequences will be worse than not attempting such an action at all..."

 PODcanon_chars.5.t: "Looking Up the Pyramid"
 PODcanon_chars.5.desc: "It is time for you to use your rightful power as master of the Tremere [Clan|E] for some good old fashioned Hermetic politics. Since you are on top of the pyramid, you will win at the end, it it just a question of what will you specifically gain from it.\nSo many choices with so little consequences! Except annoying those below you obviously. Not that it matters much."

They send you their best regards and congratulations, along with reinforcements, promising neonates of the Vizir, Sorcerer and Warrior castes.\nYour work is not yet done, but the pressure on you is now less crushing, at it seems they finally trust you to have the best interest of the [Clan|E] in mind. Even perhaps by making Iberia a future grand stronghold worthy of Haqim himself."
 PODcanon_chars.6.a: "I am the talk of the decade in Alamut"
 PODcanon_chars.7.t: "Plots Within Plots"
 PODcanon_chars.7.desc: "You managed to learn more about this potential foe. It is always an oddly comforting feeling for you, Prince Roque, as you love outsmarting your enemies and ensnaring them into a web of improbable plots.\nStill, you sometimes don't scheme only for the sake of scheming. You could exploit the information you obtained for even further plotting!"

 PODcanon_chars.7.b: "Intrigue is such a soothing pastime..."
 PODcanon_chars.7.c: "Let everyone know the extent of your scheming skills!"
 PODcanon_chars.8.t: "Making Waves"
 PODcanon_chars.8.desc: "Lord Montano, with the return of most of Italy under your control, you showed [Clan|E] Lasombra that you are still an effective and decisive ruler. There is, obviously, still much to be done to restore the proper place of the Sea of Shadows in the Mediterranean world but, at the very least, your position as head of the [Clan|E] isn't contested anymore.\nYou are now able to use it to claim rulership over any wayward Lasombra princedoms."
 PODcanon_chars.8.a: "I can do even better"
 PODcanon_chars.montano: "You now have a special bonus to acceptance of the 'Offer Vassalization' interaction with any Lasombra ruler"
 PODcanon_chars.9.t: "A Loving Embrace"
 PODcanon_chars.9.desc: "You are difficult to resist when you put your mind into something, beautiful Maatkare, but the $pod_masquerade_exposure_with_icon$ are stubborn creatures. If you are to show this one the love of Set, it will take all your considerable skills in persuasion and seduction to achieve.\nThere is always a risk of failure, which would cost you quite a bit in Set's unforgiving eyes..."

 PODcanon_chars.10.t: "Walking the Black Spiral"
 PODcanon_chars.10.desc: "You have seen those 'Black Spiral Dancers', they are utterly mad, even by your loose standards. Is the tiny possibility of an answer to your pain worth it? The only thing that can be said for sure is that you won't be the same once you go back from this cursed place..."
 PODcanon_chars.10.a: "No turning back now"
 PODcanon_chars.10.b: "This is a very very bad idea"
 PODcanon_chars.petaniqua: "You are more than likely going back from here worse that you started. But there might be a tiny hope of something worthwhile..."
 PODcanon_chars.11.t: "Madness of the Black Spiral"
 PODcanon_chars.11.desc: "People think you have come back from the Black Spiral relatively unchanged. But you know better, you never came back from it. It is with you now.\nAnd these...things you saw will never leave your vision. Perhaps the whole world is simply an extension of it. Or you are simply too far gone to care anymore.\nYou don't want to go back in there. Or do you?"
 PODcanon_chars.11.a: "There is no light anymore"
 PODcanon_chars.12.t: "Clarity of the Black Spiral"
 PODcanon_chars.12.desc: "You don't remember much of your journey in the Black Spiral which is... probably for the best. You have found no hidden truths, or sordid horrors. If you had, you would have some memories of them right?\nAnyway, despite what could be called a setback, you are relieved to be out of there. The outside world seems oddly pleasant now."
 PODcanon_chars.12.a: "It could have been worse"
 PODcanon_chars.13.t: "Strength of the Black Spiral"
 PODcanon_chars.13.desc: "There is no doubt that the Black Spiral is a place of utter madness. But you have been through so much in your life, and unlife, that it has not shattered you this time. You conquered your fears, and 'it' was pleased by your performance.\nDespite this show of force, you will admit being glad to join the outside world again. This was far from a relaxing experience..."
 PODcanon_chars.13.a: "I'm not easily spooked"
 PODcanon_chars.14.t: "Gift of the Black Spiral"
 PODcanon_chars.14.desc: "You found him.\nPerhaps the Black Spiral took pity on you, or was impressed by your dedication. Perhaps it is just a dream, a fantasy of your broken mind. You don't care.\nHe is with you now, and all will be well once again."
 PODcanon_chars.14.a: "You are meant to be King of the world"
 PODcanon_chars.petaniqua2: "You have no reasons to walk the Black Spiral from now on"
 podintroductions.116.t: "Your Story So Far"
 podintroductions.116.desc: "Lord Hardestadt, your political ascension has been nothing short of brilliant so far. From a shrouded lineage and a frontier position, you managed to expertly use the ascension of the mortal Holy Roman Empire to recenter [Clan|E] Ventrue from Rome to Germany.\nStill, old habits die hard and you had to work with Julia Antasia, the leader of the Roman relics, to get to this point. It might be time to 'renegotiate' your partnership and put these dusty ancients in a museum where they belong.\nYou have strong allies and loyal childer, keep them close and mindful of their position and history will be yours to write."

 PODcanon_chars.15.desc: "Your childe answered your summon, anxious to hear your wishes. You are known as a strict [Sire|E], the kind that doesn't easily tolerates failure. Still, no one can deny that your education choices have resulted in some of the most gifted neonates in their generation. The others well... they don't tend to tarnish your reputation for long."

 podintroductions.117.desc: "Lady Antasia, you stand strong in your exiled home in Germany but your heart aches for a triumphant return to Rome. [Clan|E] Ventrue has fallen far since its noble roots in the Eternal Senate, and you are the only one that can stop Hardestadt and Camilla from turning your beloved [Clan|E] into a mockery of itself.\nThis endeavor will take time though, but you recently found a surprising ally in your quest. The Nosferatu Angiwar is a strange one, fond of fanciful tales, but he has already proven to be a worthy friend and an even more worthy champion for your cause. With your combined might, there is still hope for the true ideals of Rome."

 PODcanon_chars.16.t: "Angiwar the Storyteller"
 PODcanon_chars.16.desc: "When your first met him, you hoped that Angiwar had insight into your grandsire, Ventrue himself. Sadly, it was not the case, as even a being as old as he never encountered an [antediluvian|E]. Still, the Nosferatu has a lot of stories to tell about the [cainite|E] world, some of which you even have a hard time believing in.\nAngiwar doesn't mind though, and is just happy sharing them with you. Gaining such friendly, free of deceit, insight from such an old, if quirky, vampire is a blessing that you don't intent to spoil."
 PODcanon_chars.16.a: "Really? That's incredible!"
 
 PODcanon_chars.17.t: "Angiwar the Confident"
 PODcanon_chars.17.desc: "Angiwar is quiet tonight and seems happy to just lend an ear to your troubles. In the [cainite|E] world, it's a rare occurrence for someone to be able to confide in another without the fear of deceit or manipulation. But you feel at ease with the old Nosferatu, knowing that your goals are closely aligned. It's no small blessing for you to have this luxury, and the sleep of ages seems a little less enticing each time you spend time with him."
 PODcanon_chars.17.a: "Friendship is a valuable asset"
 
 PODcanon_chars.18.t: "Angiwar the Warrior"
 PODcanon_chars.18.desc: "Angiwar is agitated tonight, speaking of the grave threat that his [Clan|E] is facing: the Nictuku. You have seen him like that before and, although you know nothing of what he is talking about, you prefer to humor him. Even when he suddenly asks for a training duel between you two to be 'ready when they come'. It's not every night that you can spar with such an experienced warrior and you will surely be able to learn a thing of two."

Now you are exiled from your beloved France by the accursed Salianna and your traitorous childe Geoffrey. You will return, but other matters require your attention.\nLord Jürgen von Verden, your host right now, has gathered a small force to help you, fulfilling his duty as a younger clanmate. Accepting it would be helpful, but would also mean that you are basically fallen to begging for help. Refusing it would be more in line with your station... but would no doubt anger the Prince of Magdeburg. Make the right call here, and it might be the first stepping stone to your triumphal return to the [cainite|E] world at large."

A new opportunity has arisen though, with the arrival of the exiled Prince of France, Alexander, in your court.\nYou have been a perfect host so far and continuing to do so would be beneficial for your ambitions, as Alexander still has a lot of gravitas in the [Clan|E]. But the powerful Ventrue didn't came alone, he also brought Rosamund of Islington with him, the fairest among the fair [Clan|E] and the one who has stolen your heart.\nYou have recently confessed your feelings to the lady, but it appears that Alexander himself has eyes on her.

You can clearly see the benefits of such an elite force trained by these fierce warriors but it's likely that the Khans would then withdraw their support fearing that you are getting too friendly with the enemy."

 podintroductions.284.desc: "Fearsome Karl, your fame as a hunter of monsters has grown quite a lot recently thanks to your victory against one powerful fiend named Eigermann. Your name is being whispered with concerns by the German vampires even though, to you, this monster was just another prey like any other. You have also attracted the notice of the so called Shadow Inquisition of the Catholic Church and its informal leader, Leopold von Murnau. This diplomatic man has made some overtures about trying to recruit you, arguing that you could accomplish much more inside a powerful organization backed by the Church than by your lonesome. He promises the full support of his house, which would include zealous men to command in battle, gold to arm yourself and a web of informants to keep you one step ahead of the enemy.\nHis emissaries are waiting for your answer."

 podintroductions.285.desc: "While they outwardly follow the same goal, which is to rid the world of vampires in the name of the Bogomil faith, the Gantenbein brothers are very different individuals. Basil is a true believer, a calm and patient man with a genuine love for his flock. He is often scared by the fits of rage of his brother Bayezid whose harsh philosophy seems to him like a barely concealed excuse for violence.\nThe truth is that Bayezid has long lost his youthful idealism, now keeping the facade of belief only to gain access to his next drink of vampiric blood he now crave like an addict.\nBayezid is a much more charismatic individual and has been the informal leader of the Forsaken since their inception but he is clearly leading them towards a dark path. If Basil was to quietly sideline his brother, the struggling Calomena's Forsaken might change themselves for the better... or be crushed more easily like so many idealists before them."

 podintroductions.286.desc: "In the lands of the Quick they tell the tale thus: Many long years ago, Persephone, daughter of Demeter, was kidnapped by Hades, who had seen her and fallen in love with her. He took her away to live in his kingdom as his queen. There she was offered food and drink, but she neither ate nor drank - until, out of politeness, she ate six seeds of a pomegranate. For each seed she ate, she was condemned to spend one month of every year in the land of the dead. During this time, her mother would mourn, and the land would become cold and barren.\n\nAt the end of the six months, Persephone would return to her mother and the living world. Demeter, in her joy, would cause the climate to warm and the plants to grow and bloom again.\n\nOn the surface, it is a simple tale of despair, triumph, compromise and of course, the origin of the seasons. But what of the other half of the story, its Shadow?\n\nHades was no god but a powerful wraith, who fell in love with a living girl named Persephone, and arranged for her untimely demise so that he could have her company in death. Demeter was no goddess, but a talented mage instead. The "pomegranate" was theoretically a relic, whose exact nature has long since been forgotten. This same relic supposedly helped to provide Persephone with the power necessary to drag herself back into the land of the Quick."

Your kind have been content in traveling and learning alongside the Indian people since then but this is not the case for your more martially inclined sister tribe, the Telugu Khan.\nTheir new leader has recently came to you with an alliance proposal, outlining his plan for fighting the bloodsuckers and taking back what was once yours.
