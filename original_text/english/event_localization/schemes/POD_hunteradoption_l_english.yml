 POD_hunteradoption.100.desc:0 "After a thorough training, you are confident that your squire is ready to join the fight against the darkness. With this endeavor, you are making sure that God's work will outlive you and carry on, until the inevitable victory. You hope that your pupil will, one day, make the forces of Hell recoil by his mere presence. But until then, much work is still to be done..."

 POD_hunteradoption.101.t:0 "A New Light"
 POD_hunteradoption.101.desc:0 "As the beating heart of the Shadow Inquisition, the Sisters of St-John have a heavy burden that is not shared easily. Despite this, you are confident in your new pupil abilities after this period of thorough training. Another bride of God is ready to take on your mantle if, or when, the darkness overtakes you. A small comfort, but a comfort nonetheless."
 POD_hunteradoption.101.desc.joan:0 "Acting mostly separately from the Shadow Inquisition, the followers of Jeanne are less focused on one particular skillset compared to their inquisitors counterparts. Each sister tends to be a self sufficient person, capable of handling diplomacy as well as fighting.\nStill, you have only so much time to instruct your newest pupil before having to return to your duties and choices have to be made."

 POD_hunteradoption.102.t:0 "A New Light"
 POD_hunteradoption.102.desc:0 "Often maligned, the Red Order is a major crucial part of the Inquisition nonetheless. Driven by an endless thirst for knowledge, many of its members often found themselves drawn to a darker path. You taught your pupil as best as you could to avoid such a fate."

 POD_hunteradoption.103.t:0 "A New Light"
 POD_hunteradoption.103.desc:0 "A rightfully feared force, even by the other Inquisitors, the Oculi Dei is the secret police of the Hunters. They know much, much more than most people think and are the most credible source of information about the denizens of the night. Members of the Oculi tend to be paranoid to an extreme though, seeing plots everywhere... but more often than not, they are actually right."

 POD_hunteradoption.104.t:0 "A New Light"
 POD_hunteradoption.104.desc:0 "The von Murnau family has the dubious blessing of being able to 'smell' evil. As such, they are the Hounds of the Inquisition and a valued asset, even if their non clerical ways make them odd bedfellows with the other orders. It is common practice for an Inquisitor of the family to take another, younger, member of it as a pupil until he or she is able to fight the darkness on his own."
