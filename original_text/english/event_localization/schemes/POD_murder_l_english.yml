 POD_murder_save.1004.desc: "Fire. The instinctive fear of your kind for this fickle element awakens your senses fully to the terrible danger you are in. Somehow, your [ROOT.Char.Custom('PODDomicile')] is burning all around you. An accident? Knowing the numerous foes you have, probably not. But it's not the time to consider this.\nUsing your considerable physical powers though, you are able to fend off the fire long enough to escape the burning inferno. Still a close call though."
 POD_murder_save.1004.a: "I will find who did this!"

 POD_murder_save.0005.t: "$murder_save_header$ Expected Betrayal"
 POD_murder_save.0005.desc: "There is always a weak link in any vampire's haven. It might be that [ghoul|E] that wants to be Embraced, or that servant that got beaten up one too many times or even that guard that has doubts about serving a damned Cainite. If you can find that weak link, if will only be a matter of arranging for the vampire's coffin to see the light of day in the morning.\nYou have several insights on your foe's court, and might use them to start such an operation.\n\nWell, that didn't work. [target.GetTitledFirstName] somehow seemed to knew of the impending betrayal, perhaps thanks to their considerable powers. Your agent was stopped even before he could really put the plan into motion. All of that was for nothing."
 POD_murder_save.0005.a: "I give up"

 POD_murder_save.1005.desc: "Warned by your considerable prophetic powers, you were able to know of a plot targeting your unlife. A minor servant of yours was planning to move you during your day's sleep so that you would face the sun, probably killing you in the process.\nYou dealt with him, but the conspiracy probably runs deeper than just a disgruntled minion..."

 POD_murder_save.0006.desc: "Using an assassin, while not a bad idea in itself, was probably a doomed plan from the start. No amount of preparations could suffice against such a powerhouse as [target.GetTitledFirstName]. Despite the surprise effect, and the careful execution of the plan, the assassins were easily slaughtered before they could do any harm.\nIt seems you will need more than brute force."

 POD_murder_save.1006.desc: "Some fools tried to kill you tonight. Well, they are dead now, as you were more than able to easily dispatch them using your formidable combat prowess.\nIt still raises the question, who planned this assault? Their next attack might not be as easily dealt with..."

 POD_murder_save.0007.desc: "Your murder plot has had a potential breakthrough. Your target will soon have to travel to a heavily populated area and your agents report that the mortals in this region are already close to a breaking point. Some words in the right ears and bribes in the right hand could start a very volatile riot.\n\nThat idea could have worked well... if [target.GetTitledFirstName] wasn't such a skilled practitioner of mental magic. Easily returning the crowd in their favor, they dealt with any hostility quickly and returned to their court unscathed.\nToo charming to die that way, really."
