 POD_investigate.desc.790101: "Perhaps the most influential Ventrue of history, Titus Venturus Camille was a promising young Roman tutored by the best teachers, be they Collat, his future [Sire|E] and Prince of Rome, or Lysander and Artemis Orthia of Sparta. A strong sense of rulership and a devouring ambition were soon born, and Camilla took his [Sire|E]'s throne, some say by [diablerie|E]. He will then rule Rome from the Republican era to the Imperial one, pioneering the Eternal Senate and the concept of Masquerade. It is also his command that took down the city of Carthage, earning him the enmity of Brujah for all eternity.\n Even more famously, Camilla would fall in with the burgeoning Road of Sin and become one of its more... skillful adepts. Despite his carefree and sometimes indolent attitude, Camilla managed to keep the reins of power over most of the [cainite|E] world for a millennia, a feat never seen before or after. \n He felt into [torpor|E] at the end of the Roman Imperial era, and every semblance of unity in the [cainite|E] world fell with him. He finally awakens in 1230 and easily slips back into power in Rome. But the world has changed much, and it is unlikely that the Prince of Sin will be able to once again rule over Europe. \n Future fate in Canon \n Camilla will fall into [torpor|E] during the Medieval era, only to rise in the early 21st century. An old foe will await his return to avenge a grudge as old as Rome itself."
 POD_investigate.desc.505071: "Once a soldier in the first days of Persia, Mithras has made quite a legacy for himself. Using his powers and incontestable skills at manipulation and persuasion, he soon created a new backstory, that of the Sun God of the same name. This allowed him to be one of the most powerful Ventrue of the ancient world, especially when his cult spreads to Imperial Rome. \n But Christianity and his many rivals got the better of him, and he fled with his following to the frontiers of the Empire, in Britain. The pettiness of the place quickly bore him and he fell into a cycle of [torpor|E], awakening to find everything in shambles due to incompetent regents, fixing it, and then [torpor|E] again. \n The last cycle was after 1066, when ambitious Norman Vampires ousted his power base from the island, forcing him to awaken once more and deal with it. As of 1230, the Sun God is once again annoyed by Britain and his influence is strong enough that he could consider another retreat into the sleep of ages. Though it is said that the upstart Hardestadt, claiming overlordship over [Clan|E] Ventrue, is angering his much older clanmate. This could be reason enough for him to stay a little while longer... \n Future fate in Canon \n Mithras will stay awake for some time, being a thorn on the side of Hardestadt during the Camarilla's foundation. He felt into [torpor|E] once more, to finally be killed in 1996 when Valerius, one of his former regents, betrays him. Though, some spoke of a contingency plan..."
 POD_investigate.desc.790103: "Not much is known about Robin's early days, except for the theory that he is the legendary folklore figure known as Robin Hood. His actions certainly allude to this, as he is probably the most well known Furores of the [cainite|E] world. \n Always rebelling and fighting against tyrants, he has gathered quite a following for himself and is even considered a worthy foe by Mithras, the Sun God of England. \n Future fate in Canon \n Leeland will never stop fighting the good fight. Becoming a father figure for the most influential Anarchs of history, such as Tyler, Jeremy MacNeil or Marguerite Foccart, he still resides in Nottingham, dispensing wisdom and harassing the miscreants."
 POD_investigate.desc.505103: "The only woman deemed worthy by Tremere to join his circle of Magus, Meerlinda is the voice of moderation in the Council of Seven. Confidante of Etrius, respected by Goratrix, she has taken part in the original ritual that created the Tremere [Clan|E]. Since then, her efforts to find new allies for her beleaguered [Clan|E] have been tireless. \n Mithras, the Sun God of England, has been reluctant to acknowledge the Tremere, as he is a friend of the Salubri [Clan|E]. As such, Meerlinda is quietly gathering followers and influence in the isles, with the goal of ushering a more 'amenable' King to power... \n Future fate in Canon \n Meerlinda will align herself with Hardestadt's Camarilla, securing the power of [Clan|E] Tremere for centuries to come. Her reward was the position of Regent of North America, where she is more powerful and influential than ever."
 POD_investigate.desc.790131: "A proud and somewhat arrogant woman, Melusine was forged in the intrigues of the Angevin Empire. A scion of [Clan|E] Toreador, she worked the politics of France with reckless abandon, earning her the enmity of her sister in blood Isouda and a one way trip to exile. \n Arriving in England, she hasn't changed much, styling herself as the main opposition of an amused Mithras and narrating grand tales of her past as the 'Fay of Lusignan'. Her cold and callous temper hasn't won her any friends either.\n Future fate in Canon \n Unsurprisingly, Melusine won't achieve much of significance, and is soon forgotten by History."
 POD_investigate.desc.790132: "An ambitious Baron born just after the Norman conquest of England, John has proved well suited for [cainite|E] politics. Betraying his [Sire|E] at an opportune time, he was also quick to pledge his allegiance to Mithras when the Sun God reappeared. His rule over York needs his attention, as the remnants of the [einherjar|E] Vikings are still barely subdued. John hasn't forgotten his freedom from before though, and is one of the main conspirators against the Persian Methuselah's rule. As such, he has gathered a circle of like minded vassals, including Melusine d'Anjou and Meerlinda, patiently waiting for Mithras to make a mistake.\nFuture fate in Canon\nJohn's trust in Meerlinda will prove to be his undoing."
 POD_investigate.desc.790226: "One of the rare and mysterious Lhiannan, Magda is a terrible force of nature, a manifestation of Ireland's ancient traditions. She fought against the Romans, the Christians, the Vikings, the Normans... and still fight to this day, being one of the main reasons why Ireland hasn't yet come to fell into Mithras' hands. \n Her lust for battle borders on the insane and has alienated her from any friend or ally, making her more of a beast than the druidic priestess she once was. \n Future fate in Canon \n Some weak rumors have it that Magda finally succumbed to the Beast, and was put down by Werewolves. Others think that she still prowl Ireland, the last relic of a bygone era."
 POD_investigate.desc.790438: "A stout warrior of the [einherjar|E] Vikings, Bjorn has fought for a long time against the encroaching Ventrue and Toreador of Scandinavia. Despite the help of his loyal and handpicked shieldmates, the Brujah wasn't able to turn the tide in Norway, and had to flee. Stranded with others like minded warriors in northern Scotland, Bjorn is preparing for yet another doomed fight of survival for his dying religion. \n Future fate in Canon \n Bjorn will lose once again, and flee for Vinland. Centuries later, he is the Anarch leader of Washington D.C., with a serious ax to grind against the Camarilla."
 POD_investigate.desc.790134: "A Roman legionary in life, Marcus was already a devout Mithraic before he even met his deity. Being embraced by Mithras himself was a true awakening for Marcus, who then dedicated his unlife to the Sun God he so cherished. Since then, he has been the pillar of Mithras' will in England, maintaining the cult during the Methuselah's absence and hunting any dissidence to the rule of his [Sire|E] and God. Still a military man before all, Marcus is more often seen on the battlefield than in courts or temples, leading the Mithraic faithful to victory. \n Future fate in Canon \n The Roman will suffer a major crisis of faith and will then walk a darker path."
 POD_investigate.desc.790534: "Born as Rowan in a small English village, Lord Camden always had a special link with the dead. As soothsayer of his town, he attracted the attention of Constancia, one of the most influential Cappadocian, and became her apprentice. They traveled through Europe, and the neonate proved an astute student, eager to learn everything he could about the soul and its interactions with the body, both of the living and the dead. \n When he learned of Mithras' return from [torpor|E], Camden moved to England and has begun to cement a strong bond with the Persian Sun God. \n Future fate in Canon \n Camden will become the Seneschal, main leader of the cult and even lover of Mithras. Faking his death during the Giovanni purge, the scholar will preserve Mithras' legacy, and soul, for centuries."
 POD_investigate.desc.790420: "A Visigoth chieftain in life, Siegfried caught the eye of a Roman Vampire with his wits and quick intellect. The Ventrue neonate barely survived the harrowing experience and lashed out on his [Sire|E], $pod_diablerizing$ him in the process. For this crime, he was hunted for centuries by the all powerful Roman Ventrue before being formally acknowledged in the [Clan|E]. \n Wary of politics, Siegfried took to wandering the land until he met Hrothulf, another Ventrue of Germanic stock. On his insistence, he took to visit England, the land of another old enemy of Roman Ventrue. \n Future fate in Canon \n Siegfried will flee England after protecting a young neonate. In America, he will become one of the most powerful $pod_cainites$ there, as Prince of Vancouver. His fame will then become legendary when he manages to broker a peace treaty with the Werewolves."
 POD_investigate.desc.505072: "A vestal in life, Salianna's piety and innocence caught the eye of Michael, the Godhood obsessed Toreador. She didn't take it well, and easily saw under the disguise of her monstrous [Sire|E]. Fleeing Constantinople, she wandered around the Middle-East for some time, until another incident forced her to flee farther west, to nascent France. \n There, she rebuilt her influence and soon become the main alternative from Alexander, the tyrannical Ventrue ruler. The cold war between those two came crashing when Lorraine, Salianna's prized childe, was killed by Alexander in a fit of rage. She then carefully plotted his demise, and managed to achieve it in 1224, with the help of Alexander's childe, Geoffrey du Temple. \n Now, for the first time in her life, Salianna is truly in charge. But wolves are circling around her coveted position, be they the exiled Alexander, the rebelling Esclarmonde or Geoffrey himself. \n Future fate in Canon \n Salianna won't enjoy her victory for long. As France crumbles under the fire of the Inquisition, she is betrayed by her friend Beatrix who takes the throne of France. Her exact final fate remains unknown."
 POD_investigate.desc.790138: "A young French knight having participated in the First Crusade, Geoffrey caught the eye of the powerful undead ruler of France, Alexander. Their relationship was never very good, the neonate chaffing under the very rigid and authoritative Methuselah. \n In an act of rebellion, he took part in the Fourth Crusade, losing his childe Hugues in the process, for which he blames Alexander. Returning to Paris, Geoffrey eagerly took part in the conspiracy against his [Sire|E], which earned him the princedom of Paris. Still, everybody knows that Salianna is now the real power in France and Geoffrey is, once more, chaffing under a figure much older and powerful than he is. \n Future fate in Canon \n The Ventrue crusader will never achieve much, succumbing to the same constant anger that plagued his [Sire|E]. He was unable to even retain Paris and quickly lost all relevance in the grand scheme of French politics."
 POD_investigate.desc.505102: "One of the most powerful thaumaturgist in the world, Goratrix was the man behind the ritual that turned the Tremere Inner Council into Vampires. He is also to be credited with the creation of the Gargoyles. Ambitious, ruthless but also charismatic and determined, the magus was locked in a cold war with his rival Etrius for the control of the [Clan|E] in Tremere's absence. A cold war he lost when Tremere awakened just long enough to exile Goratrix to France. \n Bitter at the idea, he still made good use of his new position, establishing a strong chantry in Rouen and a network of friends and allies. Some of those including the new power couple of the Kingdom, Salianna and Geoffrey. \n Future fate in Canon \n Goratrix's influence in France will grow until he is exiled for good and declares his antitribu. Becoming a founding father of the Sabbat, the prideful Tremere will then sacrifices himself, or be sacrificed depending on whom you ask, to permit the return of Tremere himself."
 POD_investigate.desc.505073: "A true Occitan at heart, Esclarmonde was a noblewoman who has fought all her life, and unlife, for her homeland, be it against the Moors or arrogant French. Nominally a Queen of Love under the rule of Paris, the fair minded ruler always prized her independence and has payed dearly for it. \n As the Albigensian Crusade closes around her realm, Esclarmonde has been thrown to the wolves by the greedy northerners, who are now surprised to see her endure and survive this new threat once again. Even as everything burns around her, the 'Black Queen' isn't ready to give up. \n Future fate in Canon \n Esclarmonde will miraculously defends her realm against the Crusaders and the northerners for several decades longer. In the end, it is the betrayal of her close friend, Beatrix, that will doom her."
 POD_investigate.desc.790301: "The young author of the 'Roman de la Rose' has taken the French Vampires by storm. Enamored by his quick wit and perfect description of the courtly love, many Toreador yearned for the permission to [Embrace|E] him. To everyone's surprise, it was an outsider, perfect in her beauty and charisma, that won the 'auction'. \n The [Embrace|E] wasn't kind on Guillaume though, with his psyche shattered and his vivid imagination gone, replaced by an unfathomable despair. Already forgotten by his [Sire|E], the broken poet's future sounds bleak indeed. \n Future fate in Canon \n One night, Guillaume will change his name and be at the top of the [cainite|E] ladder. He will just have to sacrifice everything to get there."
 POD_investigate.desc.505081: "The willful Isouda never let anyone get in her way. At a young age, she fled a forced marriage to join another court. Some time later, she bites the hand of a too close for comfort old nobleman. Her burning spirit, ruthless ambition and comely beauty earned her the [Embrace|E]. \n Isouda was as quick to adapt to Vampire society as you would expect. Organizing the exile or 'disappearance' of her sister Melusine and other rivals, she rose to the throne of Anjou. Thwarted in her attempt to grab France after Alexander's exile, Isouda is already planning a bloody vengeance against Salianna. Or anyone else who isn't firmly in her thrall for that matter.\nA surprising quirk of her personality (and an useful cover to hide her more ruthless side) is her love of architecture. She is fascinated by stained glass and sponsored the construction of the Cathedral of Chartres from its early days. Cainites with skills in sculpture, painting and metallurgy have an easier time finding favor in her courts.\nFuture fate in Canon\nIsouda will navigate the French politics with the same reckless attitude she always had. As such, she ends up in the Sabbat to overthrow the Camarilla's hold on the country in modern nights."
 POD_investigate.desc.505080: "Heir apparent to Salianna, Helene was a comely young lady skilled in all forms of arts when she caught the eye of the Matriarch. She was embraced younger than intended, as a result of a deadly fever that could have taken her. As such, Helene retains a form of youthful bravado and confidence that delights her [Sire|E]. \n Far from an idiot though, the young Queen of Champagne has already given precious advice to her [Sire|E], and carefully balance a web of informants and allies of her own. All the while happily dancing and listening to romantic stories in her great hall. Salianna appears overprotective of her fickle childe, but Helene's courtiers can testify that she knows how to take care of herself. However, her close relationship with her [Sire|E] makes her a prime target to anyone wanting to harm the Matriarch. And that is a lot of potential candidates."
 POD_investigate.desc.790315: "Veronique is an odd [cainite|E], rumored to be way too fond of mortals, even going as far as treating them like people. The Brujah just shrugs at these accusations and carries on, devoted to her chosen road. This oddity doesn't make her a pariah though, as she has demonstrated a very good political sense when she participated in the coup against Alexander. \n She lost a lot in the process though, with the betrayal of Jean Baptiste de Montrond. As such she has chosen to take a step back from Parisian politics to go back to her native Orleans. But trouble is never far from one such as Veronique. \n Future fate in Canon \n Indeed, the Brujah will not spent the rest of her unlife quietly in Orleans. After some serious twists of fate, she is now the Camarilla Prince of Macau where she, once again, demonstrates her acute diplomatic sense."
 POD_investigate.desc.790323: "Anatole always had a higher calling. Hearing God's voice and preaching his faith to the world was made easier for him when he was embraced by a pious [Sire|E]. Wandering through Europe, the Malkavian met his first lifelong friend, one Lucita of Aragon. The odd duo participated in the Bitter Crusade and its aftermath, uncovering secrets, plots and preaching Anatole's strange visions to the world. \n They finally parted ways when he felt drawn to a young orphaned neonate, Zoe of the Ravnos. Traveling with her, and teaching her, they have come to France where Anatole was critical in destroying the Heretic leader known as St-Lys. Now, Anatole and his pupil have moved south to hunt the remaining heretics and learn from each other a little while longer. \n Future fate in Canon \n Anatole will never stop wandering and making friends, but his faith will dwindle, making him more of a Gehenna prophet than a holy man in his later years. His companionship and adventures with Lucita will become legendary."
 POD_investigate.desc.505079: "The only official 'King of Love' is an oddity for many reasons. Considered vapid and absent minded by many, he proved them all wrong by carefully manipulating Alexander into open conflict with Esclarmonde before the former's exile. Since then, his actions are watched with more attention, especially his relationship with the remnants of Avalon south of him. Nobody really knows if Etienne is a pawn or a king in the grand game. But it might be too late if they ever find out."
 POD_investigate.desc.505126: "De Ruiz's life really began at Covadonga, the day that a Christian army repelled a Muslim one for the first time. Silvester was a spy at this time, and discovered the road taken by the Muslim and, in a daring move, even offered his services to them to make sure they couldn't escape their doom. \n The Lasombra quietly watched, and it was Cleobolus who was the quicker to [Embrace|E] the now famous rogue. Since then, Silvester's ascension has been impressive, becoming the youngest member of the Amici Nocti and the leader of the [Clan|E] in Iberia in less than 500 years. He only has to finish the Reconquista and the whole [Clan|E] could be his. \n Future fate in Canon \n Unfortunately for him, Silvester finds an even better Jyhad player than him, his own childe. Moncada mounts a coup and ends De Ruiz promising career in 1424."
 POD_investigate.desc.505125: "The last hope of the Iberian [ashirra|E], Badr is rallying her supporters to mount a final counterattack on the encroaching Christian. But the sultan of Granada has already alienated many potential allies with her callousness, branding many of them as heretics. \n Worse, she has to mask her appearance in a cloak of shadows, convinced that the revelation that she is a woman would shatter the fragile unity of purpose that she is creating. As she becomes more and more radicalized and ruthless, many are leaving the fight before it even began, leaving her in a precarious position. It might be that Badr is her own worst enemy after all."
 POD_investigate.desc.505154: "Moncada was always a conflicted man. A burning ambition and utter ruthlessness mixed with a staunch true faith in God made for a very strong potential. And a potential he exploited well indeed. First by becoming an Archbishop of the Church, then by being embraced by the rising star of the Lasombra [Clan|E]. \n Determined to obtain the ultimate power over [Clan|E] Lasombra for the glory of God, Ambrosio will stop at nothing to achieve his divine ordained goal. Except maybe the eyes and soul of one peculiar Aragonese princess... \n Future fate in Canon \n Moncada will realize his ambition, bringing the Lasombra [Clan|E] into the Sabbat and under his thrall for the greater glory of God. Nothing will be able to stop him, until the betrayal by his prodigal daughter."
 POD_investigate.desc.790178: "Daughter of King Alfonso II of Aragon, Lucita was never fit for royalty. Chaffing under the constraints due to her role as a princess, she was given to the care of an Archbishop named Ambrosio Luis Moncada. The Lasombra greatly admired her fierce spirit and indomitable will and soon embraced her. \n Since then, Lucita has been a major asset to her [Clan|E] and [Sire|E], participating in the Bitter Crusade and its aftermath, bringing back Alfonzo of Venice into the Lasombra fold, and organizing the fight against the Iberian Muslims. Lucita's star is shining brighter than ever, but she is once again chaffing under the weight of Ambrosio's authority... \n Future fate in Canon \n Lucita will participate in almost all major events of [cainite|E] history, but her faith and drive will waver. Seeking solace and redemption, she will betray her [Sire|E], only to find herself becoming more like him."
 POD_investigate.desc.505152: "Raised his whole life to become a Lasombra, Elieser is a quiet and composed knight. The Reconquista doesn't interest him as he is capable of appreciating the Moors' culture and art, this has made him many enemies, chief among them the zealous Tercio Bravo. \n Polanco rules Toledo as a neutral ground between Christians and Muslims, a fact that have seen him called to the Castle of Shadows in Sicily. What he saw here haunts him to this night, and will continue to do so for his whole existence. \n Future fate in Canon \n Elieser will join the Sabbat, mostly in an attempt to topple the Castle of Shadows' horrors. He will then participate in many more Sabbat Crusades and be the teacher, and judge, of a new generation of Lasombras, including Lucita of Aragon."
 POD_investigate.desc.505123: "One of the first Assamite to convert to Islam, Hilel had a bright future before him. As a powerful and dedicated warrior in an influential faction of his [Clan|E], he was even in line to become the next Caliph, the master of Alamut warriors. Sadly for him, Assamites' politics are as deadly as their blades, and Hilel wasn't ready for those. \n Having lost his supporters, he faced exile with a stalwart composure, but a broken will. Retreating in Cordoba, Hilel was made Prince of the city against his will, due to his combat prowess and his ability to defend it against the Reconquista. Hilel is nothing if not dutiful and he will protect Cordoba, but the fate of the rest of Iberia, or the world for that matter, doesn't concern him anymore. \n Future fate in Canon \n The final siege of Cordoba by the Christians will be the last battle for Hilel. He will die sword in hand and his duty fulfilled."
 POD_investigate.desc.791055: "Josephus is a fanatic, but worse, he appears to be a fanatic on the right side. As an ancilla, he discovered the ancient writings of his strange faith and has made it his sacred mission to bring those teachings to the world. And something powerful, it seems, agrees with him. \n Josephus practically glows from within with the light of his faith. Miracles happen around him, his hands bleeding with the stigmata. Soon, very soon, Josephus intends to march on Rome to spread the glory of his faith to the Papal seat. \n Future fate in Canon \n Around 1240, the [cainite|E] Heresy will mount an assault against this heresy of their own. Josephus will fall last, and his ashes will be carried away by a powerful wind sounding like the cries of a celestial chorus."
 POD_investigate.desc.605104: "Rafael's life is an exercise in setbacks and rebounds. A failed priest, his natural charm allowed him to persuade some monks to let him stay at a monastery, and he delighted in producing subtly erotic art to amuse his audience. This easy and lightly deviant life pleased him, until one Callisti y Castillo, a 'native Pagan witch' took interest in him. \n Rafael wanted nothing to do with the powerful Toreador, but was soon embraced against his will to create more art for her. Unfortunately, it appears that he was not the actual artist, and had very few talents himself. Thrown into a rage, his [Sire|E] almost killed him on the spot but Corazon managed, once again, to talk his way out of trouble. Since then, he handles the considerable influence and power of his slowly drifting away [Sire|E]. \n Future fate in Canon \n Rafael will put the greatest hoax of [cainite|E] politics when he is chosen to be the Toreador leader for the Camarilla. And this due to the apparent patronage of Callisti... who had no idea of this scheme, obviously."
 POD_investigate.desc.790174: "The Sultan of Sevilla is a pragmatic leader. A Jewish woman in life, she converted to Islam in death to better integrate herself into the [ashirra|E] ruling the city. This has made her many enemies, the Jewish resenting her conversion, and the Muslims feeling a lack of sincerity on her part. \n Almost isolated, Gerushah hasn't made a critical mistake yet and Sevilla's throne is still hers. This shows a keen mind for politics, and her intent is to use Badr's war effort to secure her position, or get a better one. And if everything comes crashing around her, Gerushah has an ace in the hole she might be able to play. \n Future fate in Canon \n Gerushah will be able to hold on to her power for a little while longer, even surviving a Baali plot against her city. The Christians' reconquest of Sevilla will see her exiled to Granada though, and her degrading hold on her humanity will make her an easy prey for Setites' manipulation."
 POD_investigate.desc.605113: "Perhaps one of the most influential Malkavian Prince, Roque is a skilled, if compulsive, schemer and planner. His ability to keep his fief had earned the grudging respect of the Lasombra [Clan|E], and he plays his part for the Shadow Reconquista. \n Recently, Roque has been concerned with the great number of Inquisitors moving into Navarra, which has led to the death of his childe. His fascination with plots and machinations compels him to wait and see if he can harness them into something useful before destroying them. Roque's future is uncertain, but if he can keep his own demons in check, he could remain the major driving force of Navarra for the centuries to come."
 POD_investigate.desc.605134: "A member of the Tremere Inner Council, Xavier has so far lived in the shadow of his senior Iberian, Calderon. Few would doubt his qualities though, with a sheer resilience and mind for intrigue that is very valuable to the still fledgling [Clan|E]. His different affectations have also proved a keen eye for management and the subtle art of influencing mortal politics. \n Future fate in Canon \n After Calderon's death, Xavier will become councilor of Iberia then of South America. His tenure will be very impressive, protecting the interests of [Clan|E] Tremere in the continent like few others. Unfortunately for him, forces even more ancient than Tremere himself will bring him down in the early 21st century."
 POD_investigate.desc.605131: "Zamra's unlife was born on a bet. Her [Sire|E], Nahir, thought that he could find a more promising [Embrace|E] candidate among the low and downtrodden than his rival, Gratiano, could among the noble class. Nahir's eyes stopped on Zamra, a young widow known for her ferociously independent spirit. \n Nahir overpowered her and embraced her against her will, but he also took a torch to the face when he asked his new childe to devour her own children to prove her loyalty. It then took a lowly fourteen years for Zamra to be acclaimed as Prince of Algiers and start extending her influence on all the Maghreb. Nahir certainly won his bet, but he might have created a political monster. \n Future fate in Canon \n Zamra will take no sides during the Anarch revolt, simply crushing anyone that thought her weak. Weary of the constant assassinations attempts, she will be tricked into a sect named 'Inconnu' where she will achieve a place at the higher seat. The cost would soon prove too great though, as she longs for her past freedom."
 POD_investigate.desc.605132: "Sophoniba was born in a rich Phoenician family more than eight centuries before Christ. Renowned for their silk trade, she was the prey of an ancient vampire that embraced her against her will to gain access to her family's fortune. But the shrewd woman soon managed to turn the tables, using her family to bring down her tormentor. \n Aligning herself with Carthage during the Punic Wars, Sophoniba suffered much when the Roman Ventrue destroyed her beloved Tunis alongside the Brujah utopia. She helped the reconstruction, and Tunis emerged from the ordeal stronger than ever, with her at its helm. Sophoniba is a harsh ruler, known to have no patience with idealists Brujah looking for Carthage in her city. They brought down Tunis with them once, and won't do it again while she stands as Sultan."
 POD_investigate.desc.790128: "Set's concubine and blessed with a beauty (almost) without equal, Maatkare is one of the Hierophants of the Setite [Clan|E], their leadership structure. Wielding tremendous influence, she is the voice of moderation and unity among her often disagreeing siblings. In many ways, she is seen as Set's voice during the councils. A tremendous honor that she wields in mysterious ways. \n Future fate in Canon \n The sleep of ages will catch up to her, and her torpid body will be guarded closely by the more faithful members of the [Clan|E]."
 POD_investigate.desc.790569: "A Ventrue of small importance, Datura was unable to make a name for herself so far. Better known for her pettiness and vengeful spirit, it would take a surprising turn of events for Datura's deeds to be remembered in history.\nFuture fate in Canon\nDatura will manage to claim the princedom of Vera Cruz but will be mostly known for her [Embrace|E] of one of the more influential Ventrue in the 20th century, Olaf Holte, also known as Lodin. Her failed love story with the Toreador Eletria will spark many conflicts with her childe, until ultimately breaking down their trio altogether. After Lodin's escape and Eletria's withdrawal from the whole situation, Datura will end up alone in a princedom too big for her."
 POD_investigate.desc.505094: "Said to be of the same tribe as Set himself, Nakhthorheb was the first of his childer (although some rumors debate this claim). As such, he has been the head of the Hierophants, the leading body of the [Clan|E], since Set's disappearance. \n Nakhthorheb is an arbitrary and traditionalist ruler, despising non Egyptians and grumbling at the thought of listening to the other Hierophants. Still, he is Set's regent in Egypt, and his commands are law. \n Future fate in Canon \n Nakhthorheb will slip into [torpor|E] before the modern nights. Rumors have him in Uganda near Lake Victoria."
 POD_investigate.desc.790126: "Second in power only to Nakhthorheb, Seterpenre is the lord of Tinnis and one of the Hierophant of [Clan|E] Setite, their inner council.

Aajav went into [torpor|E] and Qarakh became the "Khan" of a band of Ferals in Livonia. Some time later, Qarakh's tribe made an alliance with the Telyavelic Tremere, and the Gangrel warlord took the Tremere Deverra as his counselor and lover.\nSince then, he has become something of a rallying cry for Pagans from all over Europe, enlisting the help of Vikings Einherjars or Ferals as famous as Arnulf. His position is far from secure though, as his 'realm' is only held by his charisma, and the Black Cross is preparing a so called 'Crusade' to break his resistance.\nFuture fate in Canon\nAgainst all odds, Qarakh will triumph against the first wave of crusaders and personally slay Alexander of Paris in a duel. A peace treaty with Jürgen von Verden will spare the weakened Ferals from the second wave. The cost of victory will be high though, losing him both Deverra and Aajav. Qarakh will then vanish from history for quite some time before returning as, arguably, the most influential member of the Sabbat."

A traveling Tremere wizard by the name of Alferic noticed her talent and forced her father to release her into his apprenticeship. \n When she was turned into one of the Vampiric Tremere by her mentor only a short time afterwards, she had a hard time accepting what she had become. She asked to be transferred to her homeland Livonia, in order to study the Koldunic Sorcery of the Tzimisce. \n Their turning to paganism invited the suspicion of their fellow Tremere, and soon, the Telyavelic Tremere under Deverra found themselves censured and shunned. Deverra sought allies and found them in the form of Qarakh, a Gangrel from Mongolia, in 1155. Together with him, they founded a tribe where mortals and Vampires lived in harmony with each other and in accordance to the spirits around them. Since then, they are preparing for the inevitable retaliation of the Tremere and the Black Cross. \n Future fate in Canon \n Deverra's magic will be instrumental in saving her lover in his duel against Alexander but, weakened, she won't survive the coming attack from Jervais of the Tremere. Her last act of defiance will be to make sure that one Telyavelic survives the purge, ensuring the legacy of her people."

Answerable to no authority but his own, he roamed through Eastern Europe, watching the world he knew disappear. Sinking deeper and deeper under the fangs of his Beast, the communion with the nocturnal world became a religious experience. His unlife was reduced to its component elements: by night, he needed only to overcome a few straggling warriors to sustain himself, and by day, he slept within the soil of the forest. \n Several Gangrel opposed him and he slew them without mercy. He wanted to demolish civilization and return to primitive, simple nights; for a barbarian to surrender his strength and fatten himself with the riches of cities was the ultimate crime. He has heard of Qarakh's call of a last stand of the Pagan world and, even though he smells weakness in the Mongol leader, Arnulf wouldn't miss this specific battle for anything in the world. \n Future fate in Canon \n Arnulf will survive the coming war, and even come to begrudgingly respect Qarakh. He will then continue his futile battle, riding with the Mongols against Europe, then with the Turks against Constantinople. Finally, as a shadowy ally of the Turks assaulting the fiefdoms of Wallachia, he will met Vlad Tepes in single combat. And although Arnulf did not survive the ensuing duel, his legend will be told among the Gangrel even in the modern nights."

In Constantinople, he was sold to someone who sensed his special talents for magic, a man called Tremere. This man began to tutor the young Swede in the Hermetic arts. The young man's arrogance grew as he magically outlived his peers, blustering himself into a state of divine absolution and of Tremere's favorite apprentice. \n When Goratrix surpassed him by discovering the potion that would turn him and the others into Vampires, Etrius objected at first, although this sentiment would not last.

Shabah agreed to her [Embrace|E], and the two treated her as a mutual childe.\nDuring their time together, Belisarius and Shabah taught Anadja to be a soldier and a fighter. Shabah taught her to use her feminism as a weapon against those who underestimated her power. Belisarius taught her tactics and military discipline.\nWhile traveling, Anadja met up with the Lasombra Pietro, who recognized Anadja's shrewd intelligence and warrior training.

Her marriage to the great conqueror Philip II of Macedon made her one of the most powerful queens in the ancient world, and she changed her name to Olympias with the birth of her son, Alexander. It was by this name she would be known to history. \n When Philip was away to finish conquering Greece, Olympias enjoyed the blood of her goddess, Cybele. She nurtured Olympias hatred for men of all kind, save for her own son, whom she adored and determined to make the king of the whole world. \n Olympias arranged Philip's assassination and the crowning of her son. For this she earned the [Embrace|E] from Cybele. Alexander's army invaded and conquered Persia, and went on to conquer much of the known world. \n Despite Olympias' pleas, Cybele forbid her to bring her son into the Blood, and so Alexander the Great died in Babylon, throwing his empire into chaos. \n This was the start of a slow, painful descent into madness for Petaniqua, one that is still going on to this night. \n Future fate in Canon \n Petaniqua will have the dubious honor to be the Second Most Wanted of the Kindred world.

Like her [Sire|E], however, she was drawn to innocence and felt the urge to defile it. \n When Azaneal took the title of Shaitan, Tanit received his ambassadors at court, listened to what they had to say, and made quiet preparations to abandon Tyre. \n Future fate in Canon \n She will fall into [torpor|E] due to an ambush, leaving the leadership of Tyre and the Molochim in the hands of her grandchilde Sahar-Hannibaal."

Unfortunately, Tanitbaal-Sahar was deep in the throes of creation, laying out the fundamental tenets of what would become the Via Desideratio. This heresy made him many enemies, and one night when Sahar-Hanibaal awoke, the taste of his [Sire|E]’s blood still clung to his tongue. The night of his painful death and unplanned [Embrace|E] was the last he ever saw his [Sire|E]. \n Sahar-Hanibaal spent the first surreal and disorienting nights of his unlife under the care of his grandsire, Tanit, who chose to stand between him and the wrath of Moloch. When Tanit left Carthage for Tyre, Sahar-Hanibaal followed to repay the debt he owed his grandsire for sparing his existence. He served as her left hand for centuries, mastering the arts of warfare to enforce her primacy as eldest when Carthage fell. \n Future fate in Canon \n Sahar-Hanibaal will take the lead of the Order after the fall of his benefactor, lead them to victory against Azaneal then find new allies in the Tal'mahe'Ra."

Ma-ri became a loyal disciple to a Toreador named Mi-ka-il (later known as Michael). \n Eventually Ebla was assaulted by the Akkadians and Mi-ka-il fled the city, leaving Ma-ri alone. As the city was under attack, Ma-ri spent her last days writing her life story on clay tablets, inscribing her history, knowledge, and newfound hatred for her master. As the invaders entered, Ma-ri gutted herself with her sword, spilling her blood on the tablets. \n A Baali, Anaduk, discovered the tablets held more than just words, but also Ma-ri's memories. Using Auspex, Anaduk sank deep into Ma-ri's passion and hate. He fell madly in love with her and made a pact with a dark entity to bring her back to life. \n The tablets were incomplete and Ma-ri was only partially recreated, full of disjointed and partial memories and corrupted by hate. She slew Anaduk upon waking and gorged on his blood, becoming a Baali in the process. \n In 1204, Mary the Black, as she was now known, discovered the whereabouts of Mi-ka-il within Constantinople. During the Fourth Crusade she attacked, $pod_diablerizing$ the methuselah. \n Falling into a Frenzy of rage, Mary rampaged through the burning streets of Constantinople, systematically hunting Michael's descendants within the city.

This fact is a testament to his skills.\n Merely a lowly courtier in Baghdad, the Ravnos had already crossed paths with Prince Elaheh before arriving in the city and a serious rivalry was brewing between them. Mritunjay took his time, garnering support among the powerful $pod_cainites$ of the city before looking for the weak spot of the Prince, her [ghoul|E].\n Using the powers of Chimerstry, the crafty Ravnos tricked the [ghoul|E] into attempting an assassination attempt of another powerful rival of the Prince, before confronting her in front the court. \n The captured [ghoul|E] was interrogated, and could only reveal what she understood, which is that the Prince ordered her to do it.\n With few allies and this damning evidence, Elaheh wasn't able to defend herself, and Mritunjay stepped up to become the consensus choice for the Princedom. \n Although his hold on the city is secure, vultures are already circling around it, and Mritunjay is only starting his difficult journey to assert his rule."

She spent more than a decade transitioning as the Assamite’s titular leader in Haqim’s absence, a position that's been held by the reclusive Sorcerer Sha'hiri before her. \n Although Nakurtum is reputedly the founder of the silsila, the historians charged with recording the [Clan|E]’s history and maintaining its spiritual direction, she was the first woman to ever serve as the Old Man of the Mountain. Many younger warrior Assamites question the capability of a woman’s leadership, although rarely within earshot of their elders. \n Nakurtum takes a much more active role than Sha’hiri in directing nightly affairs, but her ideas are often met with resistance by the warrior and (somewhat surprisingly) vizier castes. \n Dissatisfied elders have secretly sent childer to seek out an Assamite with seniority to Nakurtum who they can rouse and install as Eldest. \n Future fate in Canon \n They will prove successful. Nakurtum's tenure will be a very short one, with most likely Sha'hiri reinstated as the Eldest shortly after her arrival."

Of all the hashashiyyin, no name was greater or more terrible than that of Jamal. \nA devout Muslim, Jamal rose to prominence during the 12th century, becoming the Caliph of Alamut. His immense martial prowess and inspiring faith make him the informal head of the 'Muslim' faction in Haqimite politics, wanting a closer relationship with the [ashirra|E] movement. \n Future fate in Canon \n Jamal will take over as Eldest in 1497, after the shameful Treaty of Tyre.

Thetmes, an Egyptian, proved himself well as a fearsome gladiator and won the attention of a wealthy Syrian cloth merchant who bought him. It was during this time that Sha'hiri of the Assamites took notice of the promising recruit. \n Tempted with the prospect of killing as many Romans as he would like, Thetmes was eager for his [Embrace|E]. By the 12th century he had become the leader of the Web of Knives. This informal cult within the cult is dedicated to the return of Ur-Shulgi, said to be the herald of Haqim. \n The destructive and sadistic stories about this figure make the Web of Knives, and Thetmes, a divisive faction in Alamut. Opposed to both Jamal's Muslims and Al Ashrad's old guard, the Egyptian can count on the fanaticism of his cultists to prevail. \n Future fate in Canon \n Thetmes' triumph will be slow to come, but it will in the early 2000s.

The presence of the living among Haqim's childer inspired envy, and they plotted to kill him. The magician, however, proved to be a powerful opponent, slaying ten of the attackers including a favored childe of Haqim himself. The [antediluvian|E], who believed that al-Ashrad had killed his childe out of a desire to usurp its place, became furious and both argued and would have come to blows, had not Ur-Shulgi interceded. He calmed the situation and dispelled the prejudices both held. Haqim reacted by taking al-Ashrad's left arm and eye to compensate for the loss of his childer and commanded Ur-Shulgi to save him via the [Embrace|E]. \n Al-Ashrad serves as the head wizard of Alamut since that time, fighting in the second Baali War and perfecting the arcane protections of the mountain fortress. When the Blood Curse was levied against the [Clan|E], al-Ashrad underwent the research to lift it. He became a figure of reverence and fear within his [Clan|E], especially among the Warrior Caste, who mistrusted him and sometimes blamed him for the slow progression of the breaking. From al-Ashrad's studies, however, came talismans and the alchemical potions that could create an artificial [diablerie|E]. \n Future fate in Canon \n Al-Ashrad will left Alamut when his [Sire|E] takes control of it in the early 2000s.

Riches and finery of every sort imaginable, tutelage in the mundane and mystical disciplines, sovereignty over a people who venerated him as heir to an inviolate power – all these things and more contributed to the fulfillment of Izhim Thrice-Blessed's every earthly desire. \n Izhim has since lived the lives of an Akkadian prophet, a Sufi poet, a Coptic blood-god, a Persian demonologist, and a hundred others. \n He rode with the greatest of the Assamites to the forgotten city of Chorazin during the last Baali War and was taken captive by the infernalists. Rather than kill them, the Baali took Izhim and twelve other Warriors and used their potent vitae as a conduit to unleash the first Blood Curse upon the Assamites, filling their Warrior Caste with a ravening hunger for Vampiric blood. He is still captive there to this night, but the worst has yet to come. \n Future fate in Canon \n Izhim will be broken by the demon and sacrifice his true love to curse the Assamite even more than they already are.

Seducing their leader, Hugues of Clairveaux, she managed to kill him and broke most of the crusaders' spirit.

He was born with visions, and during his mortal days he was one of the magi who gathered around the Golden One (whom history would know as Zarathustra). \n He befriended a scribe who was very interested in his visions, especially one about a strange stone that wept blood. Eventually they left and sought the Stone. The closer they came to finding it, the more intense Anosh's dreams became. They traveled during the night, sleeping during the day according to the needs of the scholar, which Anosh did not understand. Finally, the pilgrims found the Stone, and the scholar revealed his [cainite|E] nature, embracing the young seer. \n The two then left for Africa and Anosh witnessed how his [Sire|E] began to lose himself to the visions of grief, often weeping uncontrollable for hours and recklessly embracing progeny. In one of his rare moments of lucidity, the Weeping Master sorrowfully referred to himself and his childer as the "Lost Tribe of Alamut". \n By the time they returned to the site of the Weeping Stone, he began to understand the burden of his [Sire|E] more and more and began to record his ravings. Over the next few centuries, the Lost Tribe grew and attracted a handful of others. \n When attack teams from Alamut managed to capture the Weeping Master, Dastur became the leader of the Lost Tribe. \n Future fate in Canon \n Anosh's Lost Tribe won't stand the test of time, brought down by an even older force in the Tal'mahe'Ra.

In an attempt to break the man, his [Sire|E] tried to take control of the king. Eshmunazar, instead, refused to step down from his throne, believing his rule to now be divinely mandated.

His duty as Zapathasura’s warlord is the only role he needs. Although more critically minded Noddists may believe the Ravnos founder’s divine mandate to crusade against the $pod_wan_kuei$ is a self-appointed one at best, or a self-serving fiction at worst, Chandraputra does not give any indication that his [Clan|E]’s origin stories are anything less than the truth. \n Chandraputra wasted enough time for his liking.

Generations passed and Elimelech realized his curse would never be over and the elder vampire's already fragile mind lost hold of reality. \n Elimelech's travels eventually led him to the True Black Hand.

They were the grandchildren of Ra, a mighty chieftain who had conquered the people of the Nile, thus uniting Upper and Lower Egypt. As the legend continues, Set returned to Egypt and struck down King Osiris and his son Horus. Taking Egypt as his own, Set ruled in power – and perhaps (or perhaps not) sought to free mankind from the bonds of law imposed by Ra.\nThere are some Setites who reject the notion that their 'Founder' was ever mortal, or even embraced. Instead, there is the belief that Set, Osiris, Isis, and Horus were all truly gods.

She is generally held to be beautiful, fickle, vain and carrying on affairs with the other $pod_antediluvians$. She may be especially despised by Absimiliard, who both lusted for her and sought (and still seeks) to destroy her. When Caine returned to the $pod_antediluvians$, who at the time resided in the Second City, to curse them, he (according to the Toreador) spared Arikel whom he believed was innocent in the matter.\nRecords then place her as a Goddess in Sumer, until a conflict with Ennoia drove her off. She resurfaces in Crete, as the [Sire|E] of the Minotaur (a vampire having fallen to his Beast in this tale), then in Syracuse, as an advisor to Prince Alchias, before disappearing from history.\nFuture fate in Canon\nArikel narrowly avoids an attack by Absimilliard in the final nights and is now residing in Crete, being one of the few $pod_antediluvians$ not hell bent on destroying or conquering the world."

While he was mortal he was one of the founders of the Order of Hermes and creator of House Tremere, that would eventually become the vampiric [Clan|E] Tremere.\nAn eastern European mage who was known for being cold-blooded, brilliant, and a radical, he was the youngest and weakest of the Order's founders, and compensated by establishing a strict, militaristic culture for his House, structured like a pyramid.\nHe tested many spells to create eternal life, but found them all fatally flawed. Finally, he concluded that the only form of immortality, without severely degrading the use of magic, was vampirism. After becoming a [cainite|E], he diablerised Saulot in 1133 CE. After the diablerie, Tremere was almost immediately knocked into a torpor lasting centuries. His body underwent grotesque physical mutations, including growing extra eyes and his limbs retracting into his body. He is able to surface only briefly to guide the clan, though it is unknown how much of the guidance is from him, or the soul of Saulot speaking through him.\nFuture fate in Canon\nTremere will finally lose the battle against Saulot.

Claiming the land that is now Transylvania, he made a pact (or fought against, as legends are unclear) the powerful demon named Kupala.\nAttacked by Samiel during the Baali Wars, The Eldest was slain by righteous fire, but managed to take its assailant with it. It then used the part of its own essence invested into its childer and reformed itself in the bowels of the Dracon. The childlike body of the Eldest was brought to the Cathedral of Flesh and tended by Yorak, while it listened to Kupala's whispers and learned more secrets from it.\nFuture fate in Canon\nTzimisce will possess the young Ilias cel Frumos to be able to travel once more, before faking his death during the Anarch Revolt.

In one account, Caine saw the potential in Ventru when he was still a youth and took him in, raising him as his own and eventually giving him to Enoch for his Embrace.\nVentru became Caine's right hand and enforcer under the office of the Hand of Caine, and served as Enoch's proxy among the populace of the First City. After the Flood, the thirteen $pod_antediluvians$ rose up against their sires and slew them. Ventru, like the other $pod_antediluvians$ (except perhaps Saulot), was punished by Caine with his distinctive clan weakness for his role in the uprising.\nIn the latter days of the Second City, Ventru was forced to again take up the role of the Hand of Caine as his siblings warred against his rule and against one another in the first stirrings of the Jyhad. After Troile's diablerie of Brujah, Ventru departed the Second City in search of Caine. However, he was struck down outside the gates of the city by one of his siblings (presumably Troile, or possibly Lasombra, Set, or even one of his own childer). However, as Ventru probably sired later methuselahs such as Arakur of Ur and Alexander, some claim he must have survived that attack in some form.\nFuture fate in Canon\nVentru never came back, leaving his ultimate fate a mystery."

Mad with rage against the high-blooded vampires, he would have surely destroyed himself in his grief and anger in a suicidal campaign if he had not met Tanitbaal-Sahar. Under Tanitbaal's tutelage, he channeled his anger by writing satirical poems. This earned him the amusement, then the friendship, of Prince Camilla of Rome who was taking great pleasure in seeing his rivals brought low in words by the 'upstart plague-dog'.\nWhen his mentor disappeared, Pustula and his companion Camilla conspired against those who were enemies of Tanitbaal and Camilla entrusted the Road to Pustula before he fell into [torpor|E].

She knows that the Tremere are very interested in establishing the truth of the matter. If she does, indeed, have some ancient blood magic at her disposal, one that predates Tremere Thaumaturgy, then the Tremere would probably go to great lengths to trap her, stake her, and haul her off to Durham to be dissected.

She is a Brujah and has no access to $pod_disciplines$ beyond those common to most Cainites.\nAs bold as she might be, Eileen still sends a small tribute to London every year in return for Mithras’ nonintervention in the affairs of Uilidh. Eileen’s small coterie of four makes up the vampiric 'aristocracy' holding the office of baron (in Eileen’s case), seneschal, sheriff and keeper.

It was there that Hassan al-Samhir pledged eternal fealty to an immortal calling himself Hardestadt of Ventrue, leader of men and monsters, a being whose words swayed nations, and bearer of an uncanny intellect, who knew words would not always be enough.

It was Lysander who saw the looming threat of the Brujah.\nIn his travels on behalf of Rome, Lysander had heard many tales of Brujah walking openly among the kine of Carthage, ruling over them like gods, demanding blood-tithes and sacrifices.

On his orders, the Roman armies razed the city to the ground, killing thousands and enslaving the rest. They salted the earth so that nothing would ever grow there again — and so that no torpid Cainite could rise. The war with Carthage was over."

The ears of the undead hear many things, however, and thus it was that Lazarus of the Cappadocians stole one moonless eve to a hidden temple in which Lamia performed her rites before the statue of the Dark Mother.\nLamia's erudition and fervor, and perhaps other qualities, touched something long hidden in the heart of the Graverobber; and so, rising from the shadows he came upon Lamia and bore her down beneath the disapproving eyes of the Dark Mother's ebony statue.\nCome the dawn, Lazarus hid within the temple, and upon awakening inducted his new childe into the world of the undead. The beautiful priestess, he decreed, would now spend eternity in contemplation of Death, the Dark Mother from whom no one escapes. Lamia, smiling slightly, agreed to accompany him – but not until she had whispered a few of her own secrets into the ears of her gracious [Sire|E]. Lazarus stopped and listened.\nWhat she told him, he never recorded. Lazarus never again spoke to his childe since the night of her Embrace, and indeed finds one pretense or another to avoid her company. When circumstance forces sire and childe into proximity, Lamia glances over at Lazarus smiling and mouths a few inscrutable syllables; and Lazarus' corpse-like visage blanches to an even more pallid hue.\nLamia's childer keep close by their sire line, acting as warriors and bodyguards to the Cappadocians.\nFuture fate in Canon\nLamia will be diablerized by Augustus Giovanni himself during the Cappadocian purge.

This decisive battle, known as the Battle of the Thirteen Sides, ended with Temujin's victory and eventual ascension as Khan of all united Mongol tribes.\nJamugha was less successful in building a coalition. For example, he did not recruit shepherds who lacked tribal status in the Mongol tradition, which allowed Temujin to recover from a series of military defeats inflicted by Jamugha and to emerge victorious. Following the Battle of the Thirteen Sides, Jamugha was betrayed and captured by his own men, who submitted him to the now-victorious Temujin. Due to one of the laws which Temujin came up with ("Never betray your Khan"), he had the men immediately executed and later Jamugha interrogated.

Cocceius fought in its defense, but was forced to flee.\nHe hunted the senator to the city of Aquis (which would be later known as Aachen and Aix-la-Chapelle), where he undertook the work of undermining his influence by supporting Charlemagne and the Merovingians. When the Roman vampires tried to leave Aquis, Cocceius was ready and killed his former master.\nCocceius resided in the city until the coming of the Messianic Voices. Reacting to the presence of the magi within the city, the Brujah mobilized several Cainites against them, but found that he could not stand against their magic.

Using his influence, he undermined the ruling Trinity of Cainites and installed himself as Prince after a covenant of Baali was uncovered in their midst.\nFuture fate in Canon\nCocceius will rule Aachen until his Final Death at the hands of his rivals, in 1647."

After his brother was killed in 1125, Yan focused solely on these goods. Through a client's tip in 1128, he learned of a chantry in Transylvania, Umor Mons, that would buy all of his relics. When he arrived, Yan managed to persuade one of the local magi, Iusta, to take him as an apprentice. He renamed himself Curaferrum.\nWhen Umor Mons was destroyed by Tzimisce in 1135, Curaferrum was among those that fled to Ceoris. Here, he cut ties with the mages from Umor Mons and instead cultivated a friendship with Etrius. Etrius, glad to have a capable supporter in the hostile climate of Ceoris, revealed the conspiracy within House Tremere to him. Curaferrum accepted and Etrius chose a [Sire|E] for him to be Embraced. Only six years later, he appointed him as Castellan, against the protests of Malgorzata and her supporters.\nSince then, Curaferrum serves House and Clan faithfully, although his insistence of rank makes him the subject of mockery within Ceoris, with both mortals and vampires shunning him.\nFuture fate in Canon\n In 1250, due to an intrigue of Malgorzata, he will be stripped of his office after a Gangrel penetrated Ceoris and nearly managed to reach the inner chambers. After five years of periodic torture, he will be officially forgiven by Tremere himself, and reinstated as the castellan. He will fulfill this office until the Gargoyle Revolt hit the chantry. Curaferrum will be diablerized by the leader, Virstania, as a sign of disdain against the Pyramid."

It was during this trial that he attracted the attention of a local Brujah and was $pod_Embraced$.\nCaelestius quickly adapted to his new condition and merged his Pelagian leaning with the Noddist lore of the Cainites. He then boldly declared that he would travel to the Pope, present his theories and receive the Papal blessing.

With its miraculous (rumored or otherwise) properties in his hand, he was convinced that clan Lasombra would ascend to the top of the Cainite world. And so he searched for it for centuries.\nHis best attempt came when he sponsored one minor French noble, Hugues de Payens, into creating what would become the Order of the Temple.

Even other vampires often suspected he was a Caitiff rather than a Gangrel loyal to the Forest Faction.\nFuture fate in Canon\nNo one will continue to pay any attention to him, so it will become very easy for him to gain access everywhere. He will know many secrets, which in time, will bring him a great deal of power. With time, he will also develop a good understanding of politics in Aachen. He will often play the role of consultant to both sides - the city faction, and the forest faction.In 1611 he will become primogen.\nIn 1762, a cabal of Magi will notice him. Technocrats building a base in Aachen, due to the industrialization forced by Frederick II of Prussia. The Magi will close in on him, and Gottfried will escape only with the aid of a Prussian Ventrue. He will return to Aachen after the coast is clear. In 1875, due to overwhelming pressure, he will become Aachen's seneschal.\nFinally, he and Johann will be destroyed in 1941, during the bombing of the city."
 POD_investigate.desc.790295: "Wenceslas is a stern faced old man who constantly presses those with whom he speaks, bullying and flattering in turn. He particularly enjoys the company of young children; their physical and spiritual purity excite his interest and aesthetic appetites in a way no other beauty does. However, he searches for true artistry in all things, demanding it of others and dealing harshly with all those who disappoint him.\nFuture fate in Canon\nWenceslas will be part of the ill fated Conspiracy of Isaac and like all the other members will enjoy a fleeting success before meeting a grueling end."
 POD_investigate.desc.791297: "In the powder keg that is Scandinavia torn between invading Ventrue and native Gangrel, one coterie of Lasombra and Toreador is fanning the flames. Lead by a man named Gunnar Jacobson, they seek to take advantage of that subsurface tension.\nThe Lasombra want to regain some of the power they held when they were among the earliest Christians to arrive, power now in Ventrue hands. Along with their Toreador allies, they wish to ignite an open religious war between the dominant Warlords and the local Low Clans, in hopes that they can step in afterward and pick up the pieces. To facilitate this, they have staged a number of attacks on well known pagan Cainites, attempting to implicate the Christian Ventrue in the violence."
 POD_investigate.desc.790467: "Szechenyi originally was born in the service of [clan|E] Tzimisce through the Vlaszy family – a Hungarian breed of revenants who once rebelled against (and were destroyed by) their vampiric masters.\nNicknamed as the Mother of Horrors because she helped develop a purely discipline-based method of generating the terrible Vozhd war ghouls, Jolan is one of the most loyal defenders of the Tzimisce clan.\nShe prefers to look young, beautiful, and somewhat human, but with some differences. Her body has avian wings and the legs of a harpy. Her hair often has a snake-like Medusa appearance. She seldom wears more than a simple white robe. Jolan also keeps a half-dozen ghoul bodyguards nearby, which she reshapes to look like icons of masculine beauty from Ancient Greece or semi-human mythological creatures.\nFuture fate in Canon\nJolan will join the Sabbat eagerly and become one of the most knowledgeable practitioner of vicissitude of the world. Relocating to the heart of the sect, Mexico City, she will create many new horrors to help the Sword of Caine achieve its goals."
 POD_investigate.desc.791479: "As any old woman in Salento can tell you, if you wish to know if your son will return from battle or if he’s lying dead on foreign land, you must travel to Calimera and find Yannis. His daughter will find you and lead you to him, and he will only speak to you at night, from behind a veil. He will ask you terrible details and secrets, and after three nights, you will find a stone on your doorstep — white for life, black for death.\nRumors about Yannis made their way to the ears of Frederick II, who doesn’t care much about the risk of excommunication and such other papal fits when he needs all the information he can get. As it turns out, Yannis is the real deal. He has provided Frederick with intelligence he could not acquire by any other means. All he asks for is a femur from one of Frederick’s countless enemies once in a while, and a jar with their blood. This working arrangement has proven itself quite agreeable for both parties so far, but Frederick’s going to die soon, and any protection Frederick provides Yannis will die with him."
 POD_investigate.desc.791325: "Egle is the widowed bride of a dead lord who once ruled Voruta with an iron fist, blood bonding those in his domain. His disappearance saw Egle step in as a ruler, using a mixture of the fear her late husband still inspired with a more lenient rule to cow the other pretenders to the throne.\nHer rule is still shaky at best, relying on a council of elders in the domain that she can hardly go against in the fear of being summarily removed. She bides her time then, using the Setites' known talent at amassing favors (or outright blackmail) to grow her actual influence in Voruta while shielding herself being the old laws of the land.\nFuture fate in Canon\nElge will meet her end when she is forced to act against Gabija, a Tzimisce living at the edge of her domain. The monster will play her own game against her, continuing his bloody actions while still respecting the law of the land. When she will be finally coerced to pronounce a judgment against him, it will be an unlawful one. Gabija will prove it and his own sentence of her lapse of judgment will be a long and painful one."
 POD_investigate.desc.792624: "Lun Meng was once a philosopher but his life took another course when he meet his master. Long ago, Lun Meng’s master, a truly ancient and now deceased [GetTrait('kueijin').GetName( GetNullCharacter )], met a western vampire named Zao-lat, a renegade and traitor who stole many secrets of the [GetTrait('kueijin').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] and perverted them to his own advantage. Lun Meng inherited the duty from his master of keeping alive the tale of Zao-lat’s infamy and of finding a way to repair some of the damage done by this heinous creature.\nThis solitary quest has taken Lun Meng all over the world, looking for clues about the whereabouts of this dreaded creature. He learned that the westerners know of him as "Saulot" and learning more about this persona of his nemesis is his current self imposed mission.\nFuture fate in Canon\nLun Meng will amass a trove of precious information on Zao-lat. It is however his apprentice Ying Lei that will end up dealing a decisive blow against the great enemy in the future."
 POD_investigate.desc.792055: "Some Toreador scholars presented a version of the history of the Cainite society in which Ennoia was a male figure. It is said that after the Deluge, the Antediluvians rose up and slaughtered their sires from the Second Generation. Caine returned from his self imposed exile to curse his offspring for this crime. The Toreador claim that Caine cursed all the Antediluvians, except for Ishtar, who remained utterly beautiful.\nCaine believed that she was not involved in the murder of his childer. His mercy on Toreador outraged all of her kindred siblings, in particular, Ennoia who had been cursed as "the Beast". Thus, Ennoia set out to kill the Toreador Antediluvian, tracking her all the way to the ancient civilization of Sumer.\nThere, Ennoia used the name "Enkidu" and $pod_Embraced$ a woman named Ereshkigal to aid in his attack against the Toreador Antediluvian. Ishtar's lover, Tammuz, heroically provided the means for the Antediluvian escape from Ereshkigal, at the cost of his own life. Ishtar fled and proposed the embrace to King Gilgamesh, but he had already been tempted by Ennoia, and chose to side with the Gangrel.\nIt is said that Ishtar summoned some great monster known as the Bull of Heaven to help in her final escape of Sumer. Ennoia decided to stay in those parts, where "he" established a large brood of Gangrel."
 POD_investigate.desc.792131: "The only survivor of a village struck by a plague in Asia Minor, the young Duyal was saved by a traveling Sicilian monk who took pity on the boy. Receiving a monastic education, he discovered a real talent for calligraphy and illumination. This earned him a place as an assistant to the famous naturalist Idrisi who was working for Roger of Sicily at the time. Found shortly after by a traveling patron of the arts Toreador, Duyal was $pod_Embraced$ and started wandering the world alongside his new mentor. Coming to Jerusalem, Duyal was enthralled by the architecture and art of the Holy City and decided to stay.\nNowadays, he does secular and religious work both, from calligraphy on ceremonial documents to decorations on lintels and mantels. He is an apolitical and generally well liked figure of nightly Jerusalem.\nFuture fate in Canon\nDuyal will take action when his beloved art is threatened by the despoiler Marcus before being forced to leave the city during a renewed assault by witch hunters during the 14th Century.\nSettling down for a time in Madrid, he will flee when the Reconquista becomes too pressing. Sadly for him, he will fall into Tzimisce hands in the 16th century. His end will be agonizingly slow and painful."
 POD_investigate.desc.792142: "Lying in a hidden, fertile valley in the northern reaches of the Holy Land, Caine's valley is said to be a remnant of the Garden of Eden that God has allowed to continue to exist in memoriam of Abel and his pleasing sacrifice.\nComing here means experimenting something unique, a perfect balance between the Beast and the faculty of reason. Sadly, it is impossible to remain. Although it is lush and full of game, no prey can be caught and unless choosing torpor, the visitor will need blood at one point or another.\nJob is the only guide to this site and the greatest of wardens. He has never entered the valley but claims to have watched numerous enter and heard their tales when they have left.\nThose, of course, who still had the will to leave and not simply live in blissful torpor in the valley for all eternity."
 POD_investigate.desc.791068: "Alam is consumed by visions granted by the djinn in his blood. He sees the coming hordes of Hell riding over barren plains to destroy Samarkand. He has a broad and deep variety of visions, most of them are delusions: While Alam occasionally receives flashes of insight or visions of the future, for the most part he is wrapped up in scenes of the impossible.\nEvery six or seven days, however, Alam regains his senses. Usually this is when his vampiric hunger has gotten a bit of insistence and edge to it. Alam is a ruthless and swift hunter: His awareness of the undercurrents of fear and madness that drive humans’ activities at night pulls him to likely prey, and he rarely bothers to spare a life.\nAlam’s head is bald. He is of indeterminate age; the lines around his eyes and mouth are the products of madness, not decrepitude. His eyes are sunken and somewhat hollow, but they burn with an inner light."
 POD_investigate.desc.792885: "An unblinking adherent to the teachings of Osiris, Abu al-Intiqam is a peaceful and sheltered individual, willing only to live by the creeds he believes in.\nFuture fate in Canon\nBecoming the leader of the Children of Osiris, Abu will be given the greatest gift of all in 1999, Osiris' blessing. He will be redeemed before his God's gaze and returned to life as a mortal.\nHis unthinking adherence to the tenets of his progenitor will be rewarded with the lifting of the Curse of Caine from his soul, bestowing upon him the gift of life anew. Rather than die instantly, however, he will simply begin to age normally from that point on. What’s more, he will had full recollection of his considerable time as one of the undead.\nMortal once again, Abu al-Intiqam will be determined to turn the world of the undead on its ear, single-handedly, if necessary. He will view the rest of his allotted life span (brief by way of comparison) as a countdown — the ticking clock upon his newfound purpose. In the few short years that he has left, he will use all he has learned in his centuries of existence to ensure that the damned Childer of Caine come to know the peace that can only be found in the utter annihilation of the Beast Within.\nHe will know firsthand what awaits those who are worthy, and he will vow to show them the way before it is too late for them. As for the rest… those who willingly choose to embrace the darkness rather than lead their unlives in search of light shall know the judgment of the Lord.\nAs a vampire, Abu al-Intiqam had been the unquestioning head of a house of peace. As a mortal, he will become the unforgiving hand of God."
 POD_investigate.desc.792761: "Bezariel's third demonic servant is less of a servant and more a confidante. During the War, Bezariel and Neriel were friends, even lovers in some sense of the word. Like Bezariel, Neriel was an Angel of Death, but she didn't feel the sting of mortals' fear as keenly as her lover. After being released from Hell, she was initially overjoyed to find Bezariel again - then horrified at what he'd become. She stays with him in part because he knows her True Name and could probably call her back, and in part because she desperately wants to redeem him. She holds out little true hope, however. While she once knew his True Name, his association with Baba Yaga has so warped Bezariel that even this essential part of him has grown tarnished and corrupted."
 POD_investigate.desc.790761: "The Kindred situation in Helsinki is unique. Many vampires use humans as their servants and proxies. These damned souls, ghouls, feed from their masters’ blood and gain unholy strength. Most Kindred treat these beings as slaves and playthings or, at best, as amusing pets. Ghouls are rarely treated with any decency by their masters but in Helsinki they are equals. Prince Tuomo-Markus Sampsa presides over a primogen-like council that consists of three Kindred and three ghouls. Sampsa’s own ghoul, Eeva speaks with the prince’s voice.\nThe Kindred of Helsinki — indeed, of all Finland, and much of Scandinavia — spend a great deal of time in slumber. During summer, months can pass without the setting of the sun. During this time, the Kindred depend utterly upon their mortal servants. Although Kindred blood often engenders an unholy loyalty in those who partake of it, the Prince's position is certainly secured by ensuring the contentment of his servants."

 POD_investigate.desc.790426: "When Caesar's legions invade Massalia in 49 BC, the ruling Prince, Demetrius of the Ventrue, is furious. Accusing the (completely innocent in this matter) vampire Gaius Fabricius of masterminding this attack, he starts a feud of epic proportions between them and their lineages. After centuries of petty fighting, Gaius strikes a decisive blow by hiring Assamites assassins during the sack of Marseiles by the Saracens in 838, forcing Demetrius to flee his city. Finding only contempt when he tries to appeal to Alexander of Paris for help, Demetrius is exiled from France and flees to Aquileia for support.\nStrengthened by this victory, Gaius Fabricius starts another project: ousting Alexander of Paris from the French throne. To this end, he notices the potential of his grandchilde, Saviarre, and forces her to $pod_diablerize$ her own [Sire|E] before reshaping her memories. Now a perfect pawn for his plans, Gaius send Saviarre to Alexander's side where she proves to be truly skilled, manipulating the Methuselah and becoming the true power in France for several decades. Before Gaius can makes his final move however, Salianna and Geoffrey foment a palace coup that removes Alexander from power and (seemingly) kill Saviarre. With his plan thwarted, Gaius Fabricius hasn't noticed that his old foe Demetrius has been slowly gathering enough power to restart their old feud anew.\nFuture fate in Canon\nDemetrius and Gaius' feud continue to this night.

Music was her life and through it she could get her heart’s desires — clothes, sweetmeats, pets — as much of the court fell in love with the delicate music of the young girl.\nDespite her skill, her sex blocked her path onward — in a young girl the pursuit of music was charming, but as she grew into womanhood it was an eccentricity to put aside. For long years Rhiannon wandered, cast out by her family and shunned by society. She fought, fornicated and feasted, taking in every experience her young body could survive. Her songs changed, no longer the simperings of a girl-child but biting satires from which none escaped. Rhiannon’s metamorphosis pleased an old vampire, Angharad of the Gangrel, who saw in her feral behavior an ideal “daughter” for the clan.\nAt first the world of Cainites shocked Rhiannon but soon she came to revel in the new reality that surrounded her, finding in the Cainites and their politics a bottomless well of tales to be told and notables to be brought low. In the centuries since her Embrace, Rhiannon has variously praised and ridiculed most of the Cainite notables in the Isles, though she frequently singles out her distant kinswoman Baroness Seren and Prince Mithras, leading to her being unwelcome in both Gloucester and London. Instead, Rhiannon wanders the Isles, visiting the barons’ courts and other sites that pique her interest, all the while seeking new experiences for her undead body."

Suleviae schemed to get the power she craved but the Roman invasion of Gaul put a stop to her plans. Noticed by the cruel Ventrue Titus Gaius, Suleviae was mentally broken and remade into a creature of cold and sadistic demeanor, the memories of her old life purged in the process.\nThe newly christened Saviarre endured her master's ruthless teachings until her grandsire, Gaius Fabricius, noticed her and took her "training" to another extreme, forcing her to $pod_diablerize$ her [Sire|E] before conditioning her for his own purpose. Joining the court of Alexander of Paris, Saviarre quickly became the real power in France as she encouraged Alexander's lapses into mental instability.

Patrons believe the big-bellied Egyptian is a dupe for assuming hosting duties (and potential blame) for a group so eager to dethrone the Na’ib, but Aphobis is keenly aware of the risks and rewards of his position.\nHis current project is inciting the Toreador and Lasombra in rebellion against the Na’ib.

Though he prefers the broader term "demon hunter" himself, his prey of choice so far has been vampires and, contrary to most other independent hunters, not only the wide eyed and barely threatening neonates. His biggest claim to fame is his battle against Erik Eigermann, an old and powerful 4th generation Ventrue, that resulted in Karl's victory and Erik's [torpor|E].\nThe stern Bavarian is now firmly noticed by German vampires who would give much to kill, or better convert, this impressive mortal.

His present career was launched at the Battle of Samara Bend, where he alone refused to yield before the men-who-became-wolves, creating a diversion that allowed the rest of his arban to withdraw to safety. Upon returning home to Karakorum, he was summoned before Chinghis Khan himself, who impressed upon him a new sacred duty.\nIn the intervening years he has studied the unseen world, learned to use the fears and superstitions of his enemies to his greatest advantage, and brought the creatures of myth to bay before the Mongol Empire. Qorjin has chosen to ally himself with the enemies of his enemy, resulting in the formation of the "Bey's Hand", a pack of Garou ostensibly loyal to him and the Mongols.\nChinghis Khan is dead now, but Qorjin’s task remains the same: Ensure that the next time the Horde marches upon Volga Bulgaria, there is no repeat of Samara Bend.\nQorjin is measured, but decisive. He rarely reacts rashly or impulsively; he’s contemplated every contingency, so while you may catch him off guard, it’s rare to ever truly surprise him. Most times, he knows exactly what needs to be done and does it. It is said he can tell at a glance the strength of a man’s resolve, and it’s in that fashion he chose his army. He prizes loyalty and duty above all other things, but realizes that others sometimes require different motivations...if he needs you to do something, he will find your motivation. Pei Ling calls him, "the leaf gently dancing at the center of the typhoon." It seems an apt description."

There, while serving as the wife of a minor official, Ma Yi Yuan was frequently sought after, both for social events and by nobles who had troubles with the shen. Naturally, few people (or demons) expected Ma Yi Yuan to be as resourceful as she is. Many demons never realize, until too late, that the two fans she carries are her primary weapons. Exceedingly deft in their use, Ma Yi Yuan disposes of many threats to the safety of nobles wherever she goes."

She schemes to undermine their relationship and to usurp control of House Ailil and the crown of the Winter Court for herself.\nFuture fate in Canon \nFainche convinces her lover, Lord Cillian, to delay Ailil long enough to prevent him from reaching one of the remaining gates to Arcadia.

Granted, Yrtalien claimes descent from Ailil himself, through the founder's sister Fainche, but blood alone did not distinguish him from any of the other members of his line. He is but a pawn in his ambitious mother's schemes against Eiluned.\nFuture fate in Canon \nThe Shatteirng forces his depature to Arcadia. As the eldest son of House Ailil's ruling queen, Yrtalien becomes ringleader of a group of young sidhe nobility who balk at the stagnation that surrounds them.

 POD_investigate.desc.POD_fae_character_212: "A leader of the celts, she fended off an attack by Rome led by Sarinius of House Balor. The two quarreled for years, back and forth. First Sarinius would win, the Kasmeara would retaliate. Neither could gain the upper hand for long. The two hated one another with a passion bordering on mania; so much so that when Kasmeara was finally captured by Sarinius' troops, she slew herself rather than face his treatment of her. Playing the game along with her, he fell upon his sword as well, sending them both back into the Dreaming. They met again much later, after Christianity had almost conquered the lands they once knew. Once again on opposite sides, they harried one another, foiling each other's plans and disrupting each other's life through constant harassment. They dance a complex step of intrigue and one-upmanship.\nFuture fate in Canon \nDuring the Shattering, Kasmeara and Sarinius join hands and cross into Arcadia to continue their twisted games. With the Evanescence, they return to earh as infant twins and grow into bitter rivals. As fate or the Dreaming had decreed that they be tied together in mortal life, so it arranged for both to experience the Chrysalis at the same time. Together, they formed the Duchy of Shadows in Washington, D.C. and took on the names of the gods Kali and Shiva. When not attacking someone else, they turn on one another. Neither will yield precedence; neither will call a truce. Wrapped up in their love-hate struggle, they are as likely to destroy one another as their Seelie prey. Finding few threats to themselves, they indulge in games of superiority, but should a real threat make itself known, they stand against it together as if joined at the shoulder."

 POD_investigate.desc.POD_fae_character_213: "One of House Ailil's leading military strategists. Declan demonstrated a remarkable skill in weapons of all kinds as well as a tenacious grasp of tactics. Inducted soon after his Saining into the Guardians of the Silver Dragon, he soon distinguished himself in tournaments and other martial competitions. Declan's primary failing lies in his inability to avoid confrontations with members of House Gwydion, although he manages to restrict open combat against Gwydion knights to formal duels or the tournament ground. He abides by the Oath Truce.\nFuture fate in Canon \nDuring the Shattering, Eregannon ap Dougal saves Delcan's life, a debt that Declan repays after the Evanescence when he rescues Gannon in Silverwood in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley from a motley of six cold iron wielding commoners.

Though that hospitality is often used for her to spin her own elaborate intrigues.\nFuture fate in Canon \nFleeing to Arcadia with most Sidhe, she finds herself returned to Earth with the Evanescence. She becomes one ofthe few landed Ailil in Concordia with her freehold in Silverwood of Virginia's Shenandoah Valley in the Kingdom of Willows.

Skalds are the bards of the Norse, and Gunter Sorenson has trained for a century at his craft. His talent with words and song have made him a rising star in the house. \nFuture fate in Canon \nGunter Sorenson along with the rest of House Aesin departs Midgard along the Bifrost to return to Alfheim during the Shattering. He returned to Midgard with the Evanescence, but the memory of the stories of what happened in Alfheim had disappeared from his mind.

 POD_investigate.desc.POD_fae_character_257: "While the manifestion of Spring in his father's soul is an obsession with war, for Leif in Spring bloomed an unlikely love for his quite distant cousin Ygrinne. The romance between Rhineland royal and Ygrinne as the Icelandic warrior princess mirrors the old story between Gunther of the Gibica and his wife Brynhilde, Leif's great grandparents. \nFuture fate in Canon \nAfter retreating to Alfheim with his lover, they return to the Midgard after the Evanescence.

He is known for his good-hearted revelry and common touch with all the kithain. It is as likely to find him sharing a pint with a troll or a boggan as to see him debate politics among the Sidhe. He seems to have little interest in the War of Seasons. \nFuture fate in Canon \nFollowing the High King's call to retreat from Midgard during the Shattering, he travels the Bifrost with his house to their holdings in Alfheim. With the Evanescence, he returns to Midgard as part of his mother Magnhildr's company. With Ragnelf's mysterious disappearance, Magnhildr easily establised Bjorn as a baron. The possession of mortal flesh as a changeling may have become too much for him to handle. When commoners ambush one of the first Aesin freeholds, he turns on the house. Some Aesin will believe that the impurity of mortal flesh caused him to identify with the weaker commoner Kithain. If apprehended, he will stand trial and face judgement so that the matter can be put to rest."

 POD_investigate.desc.POD_fae_character_300: "Possibly the oldest of the Five Great Beasts who battle for the Triumph Casque of Sorrows in Kureksarra. Harroth is most notable for being the only one of the Five to have served the fomorians during the Tessarakonta. The Casque is a weapon of legendary destructive potential. It was used by the Fomorians during the War of Trees. It was wielded by the Red King, until he was betrayed by the Lords of the Mound, ancient cousins of the Trolls, who were extinguished for their betrayal. Dominion of war without end, Kureksarra is the homeland of dreams of struggle, competition, victory, and revenge. \nFuture fate in Canon \nIt is a curious development that Harroth has recently retired from the field, leaving the battle to Icthyus, a competent if uninspired fir-bholg chieftain of the Dark Vale. With the rumored awakening of the fomorians imprisoned under Kureksarra and the Splintered Mountains, many believe that he has again taken up his old position among the Red Court. If true, he has not used this newfound power to crush his Red Plains opponents in the field, but has instead moved his troops into a defensive posture while the other Beasts continue to fight. Reliable rumors have placed Harroth in the Autumn World, a possibility most troubling to both the Seelie Court and the leadership of House Balor. Other faerie luminaries also fear that, because of his renewed relationship with the Red Court, Lord Harroth may be immune to the Mists, retaining his full memories and Dreaming aspect. If so, his rumored return to the Waking World may soon vastly tilt the balance of power toward the Shadow Court."

 POD_investigate.desc.POD_fae_character_301: "Despite the eerie red gleam that emanates from her eyes, many Balor account Lady Eithlinn as the most beautiful of all the women of the house. Certainly, she leads the list of ruthless generals in her capacity as a spymaster. A master of disguise as well as an expert in all forms of espionage and surveillance, she serves as leader for the Eyes of Balor and so knows the most intimate secrets not only of her house, but of the other fae houses as well. Her memory for detail and her ability to recall entire conversations serve her well when it comes to planning covert strikes and acts of sabotage. \nFuture fate in Canon \nShe left with the rest of House Balor to Arcadia during the Shattering. After the war in Arcadia, the Balor seemed to have backed the wrong side, and she found her self exiled back to the Autumn world during the Resurgence. Rather than return to Caledonia, she is sequestered most of the time in her fortress high in the Adirondack Mountains in the Kingdom of Apples, Lady Eithlinn occasionally travels to other parts of Concordia, always in disguise, to pay official visits to other house notables. As Head of Security, Lady Eithlinn sits on the Tower Council and holds the internal safety of House Balor in her capable hands. She sits at the center of a vast network of covert operatives and sleepers that spends its time observing and gathering information on the other houses so that Balor may make its decisions based on accurate and up-to-date intelligence. The importance of her work cannot go without saying, for without her firm grasp of the big picture, the house would flounder in a sea of conflicting rumors, unable to sort out truth from falsehood. Because of her, Balor need not fear that their Unseelie cousins have unpleasant surprises hidden within their freeholds."

# Gordwyn https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Gordwyn
 POD_investigate.desc.POD_fae_character_302: "A ruthless warrior for House Balor, his rage on the battlefield is infamous. \nFuture fate in Canon \nLeaving the Autumn World during the Shattering, he spends his time in Arcadia training and skirmishing. Undoubtedly somehow involved in the violent conflict before the resugence, his side seemingly lost the war despite his battle prowess. With the rest of House Balor, he grudgingly went into exile in the Autumn world. Gordwyn, will command the army of elite forces that consist of members of House Balor only. His responsibilities will include not only the supervision of the training of the house's armies but also the plans for the eventual conquest of non-Balor holdings in the aftermath of Evernight. He masterminds the strategic placement of Balor troops and acts as the field commander for High Lord Li-Tili, who cannot leave his fortress to take personal command of his armies."

# Gadiel https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Gadiel
 POD_investigate.desc.POD_fae_character_303: "A noble son of Cathal,he is a dazzling apologist for the Unseelie viewpoint, and has an inherent understanding of the political implications of events. Personally appealing and charismatic, he excels in making others feel important and appearing to agree with their opinions. \nFuture fate in Canon \nWith the rest of House Balor, he returns to Arcadia with the Shattering. After the Resurgence, he will be discovered hiding in Arcadia long after most of his house had been exiled. He will steal the body of a 15-year-old computer wizard named Gerald Owens in Tennessee. Gadiel will remember nothing of Arcadia, except recaling his exile. He will burn with revenge against the Seelie who cast him out. He murders Gerald's parents and establishes himself as a drug dealer in Knoxville. He will then violate Count Oakleaf's hospitailty, kidnapped the count in his sleep, and abandoned him in the Far Dreaming from which Oakleaf never returned. Gadiel will take the freehold for himself, renaming it 'Twisted Oak'. Masquerading as a Modernist in the Parliament of dreams, he establishes an inner circle of conspirators called the 'Children of Annihilation' that seek the complete erradication of all Seelie. He will be  brought many childings to train, and those he will regard as failing will be buried in a mass gave in the dirt-floor cellar of the Twisted Oak. He will pledge vassalage to King Meilge in exchange for backing his defacto claim upon the Twisted Oak freehold."

Presumably defeated in the war in Arcadia, he will be exiled back to Earth during the Resurgence. He will take on perhaps the most arduous of positions within the hierarchy of House Balor. He will command the ragtag forces of the Thallain, continually risking his life among the unpredictable and uncontrollable forgotten children of the Dreaming (or, more appropriately, of the Nightmare). His constant association with such creatures will likely drive him completely mad."

# Rowhenne https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Rowhenne
 POD_investigate.desc.POD_fae_character_305: "The youngest daughter of Cathal, Rowhenne seems to spend as much time in other Unseelie courts of Hibernia as she does with her own family in Caledonia. In particular, she treats with the seducers of the Leanhaun and the courtiers of Ailil perhaps because of their hold on the Isle of Dreams and Court of All Kings.\nFuture fate in Canon \nWith the retreat of Houses Balor, Ailil and Leanhaun to Arcadia with the Shattering, she fled the Autumn World through Silver's Gate. With the Resurgence, she found herself returned to Earth. For the Balor, she will become the Lady General of the Forces, and act as the representative of House Balor to the armies of the Shadow Court. Her expertise in dealing with the warriors of Ailil and Leanhaun (such as they are) will ensure the cohesion of the Unseelie army."

 POD_investigate.desc.POD_fae_character_306: "Despite his lack of a left hand, Raghnall has more than proven his worth as a warrior and leader within the house. He spends more time with the Prodigals than he does with other fae, causing him to demonstrate some peculiar mannerisms. He has been known to break into wild bursts of howling at the full moon, a habit derived from his association with various groups of Black Spiral Dancers. He has also acquired a taste for drinking blood, something he learned from his allies among the Children of Lilith.\nFuture fate in Canon \nRather than staying with his beloved Prodigals, he goes with the rest of the Balor to Arcadia during the Shatteringer. With the Resurgence, he can finally return to earth and renew his relations with Vampires and Wyrm worshiping Werewolves. He will live in a high rise penthouse in the suburbs of Chicago. From his freehold in the Kingdom of Grass, Raghnall will oversee the ranks of Prodigal allies who have pledged themselves to join Balor's fight against the children of the Tuatha de Danaan in return for Balor's assistance in their own versions of Doomsday. Whether or not he intends on fulfilling his obligations will remain unclear. Many of the house will believe that The Dancemaster waits to see whether or not the arrival of Evernight precedes the cataclysms of the werewolves or vampires before he commits any house troops to foreign struggles."

# Black-Tongue Dooley, https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Black-Tongue_Dooley 
 POD_investigate.desc.POD_fae_character_307: "Foul in the extreme, no crime is too hideous for Dooley. He has raped children, tortured helpless captives, stolen food intended for a hungry, given poison to a 12-year-old just to see what would happen, all in the pursuit of Glamour. He makes an art form of pain and torture, delighting in causing mental anguish in equal measure. Because of his particular deformity (a hideous-looking black and putridly rotting tongue), Black-Tongue cannot speak. He communicates either by gesture or through writing out his questions, answers, and thoughts. Nor can he taste food. In his fae mien, his hair becomes a tangled knot of graying brown and the stubble masquerades as a short beard. His mouth is a brown slash in his face, and his black tongue lolls half out of it, dripping saliva down his chin. When he manages to pull his tongue in, he looks almost normal, though still ugly for a sidhe.\nFuture fate in Canon \nHe returns to Arcadia with the rest of the Balor during the Shattering, only to return again with the Resurgence. Once exiled to Earth, he meets with Doireannara of House Ailil and becomes her most ardent recruit. He will be at his most effective as the silent, sinister figure who lurks behind Doireannara whenever she addresses the troops. They will respect and fear her, but they will be terrified of Dooley. He will need only to lick his lips with his putrescent black tongue to command instant obedience. He will delight in inflicting little tortures even on his comrades-in-arms, requiring them to stand perfectly still for half an hour while balancing on their toes, for instance. Alternatively, he occasionally will require 'favors' to refrain from such pastimes. Inability (or refusal) to perform will be met with swift and painful punishment. Unknown to him, however, Doireannara will begin watching him and be prepared to squash him like a bug."

 POD_investigate.desc.POD_fae_character_308: "Edana has made it her task to find the necessary gold and treasures to support House Balor's shadowy war for the Ever Night. A dark-haired beauty with a natural eloquence that enables her to charm others into giving her gold and promising favors, she has become one of the Shadow Court’s chief recruiters and apologists. Those Kithain to whom she speaks find themselves longing for the freedoms and camaraderie she promises as members of the Shadow Court. Some have embraced their Unseelie natures simply to be allowed to remain in her vicinity. Such is her charisma that many believe she is in love with them, too — even in the face of proof to the contrary. She embodies the picture of Irish beauty. The skirts also conceal the deformity that is part of her birthright as a member of House Balor — a twisted ankle and foot. Wearing a special boot, she manages to move gracefully despite the slight limp she cannot hide and the slowness of her progress.\nFuture fate in Canon \nWith the Shattering, she retreats with the rest of her House to Arcadia. When she returns to the Autmun World with the Shattering, she choses the body of an heiress of a prominent Anglo-Irish family from County Derry, Edna Bayler will enjoy the luxuries of the privileged class while secretly siphoning off portions of the family wealth to purchase munitions, weapons, explosives, and other supplies for her current favorite terrorist groups. She raises capital to support armed insurrection in Northern Ireland and a half-dozen other countries.

His eyes are a piercing grey and look as though they would suck the life out of whatever he turns his gaze on. He is always hungry... for food, excitement, treasure, Glamour, pain, pleasure, or praise. He can never get enough and he always hungers for more, even when he has just been sated. \nFuture fate in Canon \nLorenzo will sent from Arcadia to Earth to prepare for the takeover by House Balor. He will be geased to work on their behalf to bring down the Seelie courts of Hibernia. Since he will be under a geas, even he will sometimes not know why he does what he does. He arrives in Ulster with no memories, but quickly comes into contact with Doireannara who tasks Lorenzo with insinuating himself into the court of King Finn of House Fiona. Supposedly gathering glamour through marking talented mortals for musing, he is actually a ravager who brings back tainted Dross for Finn. Finn designates Lorenzo his secret champion.

 POD_investigate.desc.POD_fae_character_311: "An ambitious Balor lordling, he once had a scheme to lead a Roman legion to Gaul and conquer a Kingdom for himself, but his campaign was thwarted by Kasmeara ni Ailil. The two quarreled for years, back and forth. First Sarinius would win, the Kasmeara would retaliate. Neither could gain the upper hand for long. The two hated one another with a passion bordering on mania; so much so that when Kasmeara was finally captured by Sarinius' troops, she slew herself rather than face his treatment of her. Playing the game along with her, he fell upon his sword as well, sending them both back into the Dreaming. They met again much later, after Christianity had almost conquered the lands they once knew. Once again on opposite sides, they harried one another, foiling each other's plans and disrupting each other's life through constant harassment. They dance a complex step of intrigue and one-upmanship.\nFuture fate in Canon \nDuring the Shattering, Kasmeara and Sarinius join hands and cross into Arcadia to continue their twisted games. With the Resurgence, the return to earh as infant twins and grow into bitter rivals. As fate or the Dreaming had decreed that they be tied together in mortal life, so it arranged for both to experience the Chrysalis at the same time. Together, they formed the Duchy of Shadows in Washington, D.C. and took on the names of the gods Kali and Shiva. When not attacking someone else, they turn on one another. Neither will yield precedence; neither will call a truce. Wrapped up in their love-hate struggle, they are as likely to destroy one another as their Seelie prey. Finding few threats to themselves, they indulge in games of superiority, but should a real threat make itself known, they stand against it together as if joined at the shoulder."

# Queen Maeve # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medb https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Cuchulainn
 POD_investigate.desc.POD_fae_character_201: "Also known as Queen Medb, she is the strong-willed, ambitious, cunning and promiscious wife of Ailil. She is infamous for having led her people to take An archetypal warrior queen, she is believed by some to be a manifestation of the goddess of Sovereignty. She infamous desired to steal the prize bull of the King of Ulster, and started the Táin Bó Cualnge (The Cattle Raid of Cooley). Cuchulainn, son of Lugh, attempted to thwart Maeve's forces, but the Queen still managed to steal the bull, but Cuchulainn was able to mortally wound it, denying Maeve her prize.

Maeve is still bitter towards her ex-husband Conchobar, and desires his destruction. When Maeve asked a druid which of her sons would kill Conchobar, the druid replied 'Maine'; subsequently Maeva has renamed each of her sons 'Maine'. \nFuture fate in Canon \nWhile bathing in a pool on Inchcleraun, she is killed when struck in the head with a pice of cheese by Furbaide armed with a sling. Near Sligo, atop Knocknarea Mountain, rests a massive stone cairn reputed to be the burial mound of Queen Maeve of Connaught (an honor claimed by a number of other megalithic sites in western and northwestern Ireland). The massive mound of stones (weighing in at nearly 40,000 tons) is clearly visible from five counties, the fickle weather of Ireland permitting, of course. Despite its temptation to archaeologists, the cairn has never been explored or excavated, although many visitors to the area undertake the hour-long climb to the top of Knocknarea to view it up close and personal. Tradition dictates that each pilgrim to the cairn brings with them a rock to add to its mass, a custom which, over the years, has made the thought of probing its contents increasingly less likely. After her death, Maeve will become one of the most famous of Fae Queens thanks to Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet'."

Known as Canute the Great, he ruled over the North Sea Empire of England, Denmark and Norway until 1034 AD. To rule over the recently (by Fae reckoning) conversion of the population to the Christian Church, Knud learned the rituals and lore of the faith. He imitated the pious too well and end up joining the Constantinian cause, albeit with Winter's particular take as a Viking reaver king hell bent on conquest. The moment of his conversion is told in the story 'Canute and the Tide'. The king set his throne by the sea shore and commanded the incoming tide to halt and not wet hsi feet and robes. He attempted a powerful cantrip to this effect, and in sight of true belivers... his magic faltered. The tided continued to rise as usual and dashed over his feet and legs without respect to his royal person. Knud leapt backwards saying 'Let all men know how empty and worthless is the power of kings, for there is none worth of the name, bu He whom heaven, earth, and sea obey by eternal laws.'  He then hung his gold crown on a crucifix, and never wor it again 'to the honour of God the almighty King.'
