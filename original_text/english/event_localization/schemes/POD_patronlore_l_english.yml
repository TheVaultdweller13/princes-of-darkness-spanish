In the years precluding Rome's collapse to Gothic hordes, Loukios deserted when the wars began to grow helpless and became ever more enamored with the Egyptian mythos to the point that he made a pilgrimage to the land of the sifting sands to better understand his goddess.

 POD_patronlore.100.t.560002: "Patron Lore: Ciarán"
 POD_patronlore.100.desc.560002: "This character was created by one of our supporters and isn't an official part of the [world_of_darkness|E].\n\nCiarán was an Irish Traveller, or more accurately, a Mincéirí or one of an lucht siúil (literally, 'the walking people'). He was a young man of twenty-three that simply did what he needed to survive and support his family. Often that meant lying and cheating because he did not have many other skills. Regardless of his dishonest nature family was always the most important thing to him, and he saw all of an lucht siúil as his family. Any nomad he respected almost as much. Which was why he offered a home to a strange Hindustani traveller calling himself Viswanathan.\n\nUnbeknownst to him, Viswanathan was a methuselah, a fifth-generation Vampire of Clan Ravnos and a man who had travelled across the known world to find himself in Ireland. Fortunate, because their camp would soon be raided by locals and the Irishman fatally wounded. Viswanathan betrayed his own principles to embrace Ciarán, saving his life. He taught him of the Path of Paradox, and warned him to never do what he just did. Then he was gone.\n\nEven now Kindred, Ciarán could not bear to  leave his family and his people behind. Especially when they faced such prejudice and hostility from the communities they came into contact with. This hostility in Ireland was growing to a head of steam, which lead them to leaving not long afterward.  Ciarán became determined to find them a safe home.\n\nSo they travelled, for decades, picking up other nomads along the way. Unfortunately Ciarán could not keep his promise to Viswanathan and did once save the life of a young woman among his people, named Caiomhe. She was the only Kindred among his community who he personally sired, but many others did join them in the journey along the way. Some Ravnos, some not. As Viswanathan had told him, Ciarán would declare his clan as Gangrel to anyone other than his people (although he did his best to maintain the masquerade with them).\n\nEventually, they reached Hungary. Largely through deception, manipulation and a healthy dose of Chimerstry, the three things Ciarán was best at, he convinced the local barons to allow his people to make a home here, unbothered."

He was larger than most boys his age and used that size to intimidate other children. He learned in his early adolescent that people would pay for information, so he started starting to gather as much information as he could for blackmail or trade through eavesdropping, discretely following, or just plain intimidation. He ended up as a young adult running a small information ring in the city of Sarria where he was noticed by a visiting vampire. He noticed José's talents, and decided he would make a perfect candidate to sire. José and his sire had a tumultuous relationship, which ended with José diablerizing the elder.\n\nIn the 1300s, José becomes the head and sole kindred of the small house deCalamar, taking over the duchy of A Corunnà and promising himself that he would rule the Iberian Peninsula in the name of the Beast."

For years he traveled through cities already old, his sire instilling a thirst for knowledge to help fight the stagnation of time. As a follower of Tariq el-Sama, Descardion believes that the struggle between self and the beast are an ultimate test by Allah. Descardion has settled at the the mouth of the Nile where life begins for many in North Africa, and works diligently to bring about learning and faith to those around him. His experiments are often internalized but he has taken extreme measures in the past such as ghouling an entire village or personally enforcing month-long fasts to purge mind and body (and weak individuals) from local tribes. As one of the few literate people in the quarry, a reason he was initially embraced, Descardion has maintained a volume of journals and prizes the written word such that his court values education and tactics more than any other trait. As tales travel of the Tremere and Ventrue wars against the Tzimisce, Descardion has become increasingly concerned about protecting his work and has become pro-active in North Africa seeking to prevent the Kings and Pyramid from controlling the people of Egypt."

He showed himself capable in combat, earning him a place as the youngest member of his lord's guard, this was soon followed by a position of command in his armies. The young man would have a chance to prove himself during a rebellion in Normandy. Over the course of five years he managed to be captured three times. Twice he was ransomed, and once he escaped. In spite of these unfortunate situations, he was lauded for his bravery and skill, earning the trust of the king himself. The highpoint of his career brought an end to the war, at the Battle of Brémule 1119 he managed to rout the enemy cavalry and led a charge into their right flank. The maneuver had nothing to do with the orders he was given and was described as both "a stroke of genius" and "an act of sheer lunacy". In either case, it led to a decisive victory, one that seemed to cost Aryan his life. Namely, after the impact of his famous charge, he began to pursue the retreating army, followed by a token force at best. He found himself surrounded behind enemy lines, where he was impaled by a spear and left for dead. His own men found him still alive and brought him to be treated at camp, but there was little hope of recovery. A friend was sitting by his side when a man walked into the tent. He recognized him, one of the king's advisors. His friend left at the man's request and the two of them were left alone. "That does not look good at all. I'd say you have an hour, maybe two." The man didn't wait for an answer "I can make sure you survive this, in return you will be sworn to me for the rest of your life, however long that may be. Do you accept?" In his pain and delirium, he did and woke up in an unfamiliar place serving an entirely different master."

Seeking new secrets, he started by learning under the church wing. Taking his vows, he became a monk in the Hohenbourg abbey, on the top of the 'Mount St Odil'. While he learned classics, he also became increasingly curious about the 'Pagan Wall' (Heidenmauer), an ancient celtic wall surrounding the mountain, thought to predate christianity. He also learned about tales of strange creatures, haunting the neighboring Schwarzwald. Great humanoids, seven foot tall and with black eyes.\n\n His forbidden quest to know the origins or the wall and his increasingly interest for pagan affairs brought to him the attention of one wandering outcast of the Tremere Clan, Jonas Helid. After being embraced by this one, he leaved his monastic life behind to travel, away from the sun.\n\nDuring his unlife, he and Jonas travelled to Bologna where they took a supportive role in the foundation of the University in 1088. Interested in knowledge from the ancient times, Wilhelm took inspiration of Persian tales for his new name — Cyrus. A new name for his unlife.\n\nIn 1180, after a failed attempt to rejoin the Tremere Clan with his sire, he came back at his home region, near the rhenish city of Kolmar. Needless to say, that's all it took for him to be contacted by Marconius of Strasbourg, the founder of the Kiasyd bloodline, and former mage. Despite being from different clans,their academic interests brought them together. In the name of knowledge, they forged an allegiance."

From childhood he knew how to conciliate and acquire the necessary connections. One evening, he met a young girl who was accompanying the ambassador of the Byzantine Empire. The girl was amazingly beautiful, but more importantly, besides her, there were no more guards. This circumstance allowed Anatolius and his elder brother to make acquaintance with girl in a local tavern. According to her story, they returned after negotiations with the Kiev prince and stayed here for changing horses and some rest. Thanks to his natural charm, Anatolios was able to convince the girl to stay overnight at their house... at least that's what he thought then. It was the last night for him as a human. In the morning he found the mutilated and dried bodies of his family. On cold corpse of his elder brother he found a message: 'The next meeting will be at my place. Your Arianne.' A few days later, the servants of the Toreador contacted him and gave instructions about the meeting place with the rest of the relatives.\n\n9 years have passed since he was accepted into a new family.

His will on the battlefield and his careful management of troops and positioning led him to get many successful battles. He was spotted during one of those by Brunhilde. As he was dying after killing four assailants, she embraced him and left him alone in the wilds to survive. During those times, he learnt how much social abilities and schemes serve only the weak and used his cunning and strength to hunt with unrelenting effectiveness. After learning what he had become, he began to actively lay waste to those who would spit on the gods. Acting as a commander and executioner, he was sent to kill off the rotten roots of the tree of life. Any Einherjar who strayed from the path had to answer for their crimes against the gods and few of them lived long enough to join the christians. Alas with every battle he won, others were lost and the christians never seemed to back away. Worse, they poisoned the hearts of his flock and the many quarrels amongst the Einherjar led Midgard to crumble. After Odin disappeared, disgusted with the human failure to recognise true power and uphold the ways of the Aesir, he secluded himself in his ancestral home of Helgum, not participating in any new battle. But he never lost faith. If Odin was to wake up, he would take his axes again and storm the battlefield once again."

While he believes that humans shouldn't lie, or murder (unless their vampire lords tell them to), he believes that vampires are allowed to use the tools "For a Greater Good". He believes people are good or evil, either or and sees the world in black and white. He was embraced by Goratrix as a priest with an immense knowledge of religion and the occult. When embraced, Sutherland tilted. To an extent that even Goratrix had to send him for a while to Malta, so he could calm down, and get his mind straight. His coping mechanism made him still believes that he is an agent of God, but then he start seeing the world as black and white, Good and Evil.

Originally a mage too young to be embraced by the clan founder himself, Morgano was embraced by Goratrix shortly after the ceremony. He had been instrumental in the capture of a number of Styrian Tzimisce and post embrace set out to learn the secrets of their blood. Due to his proximity to the Ritual of Usurpation, the clan discipline of the Tzimisce, Vicissitude was present in his blood. This rare trait that occasionally appeared in Tremere throughout the ages quickly became the focal point for Morgano's studies. He believed that the manipulation of flesh and bone through Vicissitude could potentially unlock many alchemical secrets and quickly learned new ways to implement the power into his Thaumaturgical blood sorcery.\n\nThis unique gift of his, and the relative success of his experiments gained him notoriety amongst his clan. Morgano Murchadha's hunger for power was reflected in the cruel nature of his experiments and he had a hand in causing the Tzimisce declare their war upon the fledgling house Tremere. As a result Morgano was exiled from house Tremere and he and his followers were spared the blood bond in the structuring of the pyramid in 1037. Outraged by his exclusion from Tremere politics and urged by his hunger for power, he took the few he had embraced with him and created the House of Murchadha, a cadet branch of the original Tremere who set up their base in Esztergom after murdering the original Voivode situated there in an act of monomancy.\n\nFrom his new seat of power, Morgano of the House of Murchadha began launching invasions of the surrounding Visegrad, in spite of the vast number of enemies around him. Many of his followers, whilst believing such attacks were suicidal, were surprised to find themselves winning repeated victories. The different Voivodes in Hungary were as much in conflict with each other and the main branch of House Tremere as they were with Murchadha.\n\nThese initial victories led to the capture of many fairly powerful kindred who sated Morgano's desire to experiment and create new powers, thus he instead turned his focus from conquest for a while into travel. Morgano ventured into the Baronies of Avalon and the Courts of Love in France where he reportedly sired 2 of his childer. A young noble girl by the name of Charlotte in the Kentish city of Canterbury was his first childe. It is unclear if it was some fleeting mortal concept of love that drove him to do so or some other aspect of her that captivated his interest. His other childe was a travelling mage from the order of Hermes that he coincidentally met by the name of Niklaus. By the time of their meeting Morgano was a formidable wielder of blood magic and utilized other vampiric disciplines, specifically vicissitude to get close enough to people that they were unable to react to his attack. Niklaus hated Morgano for embracing him, he considered it a cruel joke on Morgano's behalf and spent many years trying to track him down to his Esztergom chantry.\n\nMorgano became known for his madness in more recent nights, after having emerged from his secluded research, the Warlock saw many of the lesser kindred such as Caitiff had risen to positions of prominence. Having studied the Gehenna prophecies heavily, he took this as an omen and began his own crusade to wash Europe clean of the clanless, rallying many traditionalist vampires to his side as he did so. Whilst he used to experiment on his captives, the Mad Lord of House Murchadha now chose to burn his enemies at the stake or in their homes, sometimes whole villages and towns were burned to the ground if there were rumours that they harbored the clanless. Yet because of his isolation and the indifference of the high clans, no one has stopped Morgano's mad scouring of Hungary."

He built up something of an ill-repute, owing to the fact that he freely mingled with unscrupulous merchants, thieves, and blackguards. His deviancy and willingness to bend laws for his benefit would draw the attention of a powerful Lasombra, looking for a mortal to embrace.\n\nFollowing the embrace, Jimeno found himself drawn to the murky waves - as some Lasombra are. He recruited the criminals he knew in his previous life to crew his ships and set off on a great voyage filled with adventure, battle, and lots of plundered booty. Raiding and reveling is good enough for some corsairs, but Jimeno eventually found his life at sea... restricting. Using the chaos in the Levant caused by the crusades, he seized control of a few key ports and decided to 'set-up shop'. The Court of Crows was born. Since then, Jimeno's power has expanded slightly to encompass most of Syria and few scattered lands across the sea. Jimeno dreams of creating a pirate kingdom mighty enough to rule itself without fear of others meddling in its affairs; where every vampire will be free to live and die as he pleases."

It was once Matthaios Dragastes, a Romaniote Jewish mystic who practiced the Kabbalah Ma’asit using Qliphothic magic in ages past. Matthaios’ study and skill with such magics made him a person of interest for the Vampires who dwelt within Ancient Constantinople and eventually a childe of the Tzimisce Methuselah Andeleon (Likely Urdo "Master of Hellhounds, but perhaps Jedrik "the scholar") gave the embrace to the mystic under his sire’s instructions.\n\nUnder Andeleon’s tutelage, Dragastes studied the discipline of Vicissitude in all its many forms, and his mastery of the discipline swiftly grew beyond his years in a similar fashion to all of Andeleon’s progeny. As his mastery of Vicissitude solidified, Dragestes found that when he reached out to the Qliphoth, as he had done when he was alive, he could feel an ancient intelligence that dwelt within the anti-life pressing against his consciousness. Under Andeleon’s guidance, the mystic communed with this great intelligence. They revealed to him many great secrets of Vicissitude and told him of the ancient, unnumbered crimes of beings called the Nephilim. Drawn by these Eldritch entities, Matthaios sojourned into the [UmbraGlossary('shadowlands')] and journeyed to the forests of D’hainu, the ruins of the Second City, and the roots of Mount Meru.\n\nIn these travels, the Watcher’s, as these Qliphothic entities called themselves, broke down Matthaios’ mind and rebuilt it as an extension of their own. Driven mad by eldritch revelations and possessed by these malevolent entities, Matthaios added direction and voice to the emerging Assaku brood that slowly grew like a tumor in Kindred society. Matthaios became a sort of prophet for the Assaku, communicating directly with the Watchers and proclaiming maddening revelations in their name. As the main line of communication between the growing Assaku blood cult in Constantinople, and the Qliphothic masters they served, the rest of Andeleon’s brood began to name Dragastes the “Whisperer in Darkness” as he became a Hierophant for the Growing blood cult.\n\nPosing as a wandering mystic, Dragastes used his Vicissitude to heal the sick and wounded of both Kine and Kindred alike. However, With every healing, his tainted blood spread to the masses, rotting them from the inside out and corrupting them into mere extensions of the Assaku’s will. Potentially Dragastes’ curse may have spread across much of the Mediterranean. However, the Assaku, or more correctly the Watcher’s who dominated his will, had underestimated the other Kindred of the City. The Dracon, an ancient Tzimisce whose knowledge of Vicissitude eclipsed even that of the Assaku, rooted out many of Matthaios’ cults and swiftly drove the rogue Tzimisce to flee the city. However, some remnants of Dragastes’ madness remained in the fringes of ancient Byzantium, though centuries of preparation and plotting had been undone in a brief few years. Although the victory of the Trinity over the Assaku had been swift, the Methuselahs who ruled Constantinople covered up the vanquished Blood cult to preserve the image of a stable and infallible Dream.\n\nFollowing Dragastes’ expulsion from Constantinople, the wandering Hierophant of the Assaku would seemingly vanish off the face of the map. Some would whisper that the Assaku cult had been pursued across Europe and the middle east by the Elioud. Only recently, the “Whisperer in Darkness” has resurfaced under a new name in the furthest corners of Siberia, having seemingly thrown off the pursuit of the Tal’mahe’ra for the time being."

Little information has reached us to this day although we can assume noble origins and an interest for arts or music. The testimonies on his meeting with her Sire Amphion the "Musician" were lost in the meanders of time, however from her physical appearance we can estimate that she received the embrace before her first thirty springs. Here relatively modest ascension within the clan has left no remarkable facts for posterity, thus leaving a void until -519 BC when she left Greece for Rome in the midst of conflict between Thebans and Athenians. She undertook patronage activities for kindred artists under Toreador's protection and does not seem to have had an important role in the intrigues of the clan or the Roman Empire. In -509 BC she met Tanitbaal-Sahar, guest of Titus Venturus Camillus, who taught her the precepts of his philosophical treatise "On Hunger and its Satisfaction" of which the Via Desideratio is its heir. From that day Niobe took an active part in the affairs of the young Roman republic to promote the libertarian values of the Via Desideratio but ran into opposition from the cults of the Via Regalis and Via Caelis. Marginalized for its customs deemed amoral, the followers of the Via Desideratio were stamped with the seal of infamy and designated as sinners, it went so far as to be renamed the Way of Sins by its detractors. Niobe left Rome  towards the end of the 1st century BC to go to Narbonne where she resumed her proselytizing activities. In the 10th AD she founded a cult dedicated to the Via Adversarius in the county of Toulouse in order to spread the beliefs of the Way of Sins in the South. At the dawn of the Cathar heresy Niobe influenced and organized them with the aim of destabilizing the Church of Rome in Occitania. During the Albigensian crusade, she first joined the Court of Esclarmonde la Noire, helped her to repel the northern invasion and then, with the support of the Occitan princes of the opposition, dismissed Esclarmonde for her benefit. Niobe was able to strengthen her influence in Occitania and convert this region to the Way of Sins, finally realizing her dream of a land of asylum for her oppressed acolytes."

Grigori was instantly obsessed with the concept of eternally trapping a tortured soul within himself and so started to plot. Getting Andreas in a vulnerable position wasn't hard: his sire already put his full trust in him and Grigori knew well of his passion, so the schemer only needed to pretend reciprocated feelings. A month later, the deed was done, and Grigori managed to hide his guilt well, savoring the torments of his sire within his mind. Wishing to distance himself from the rest of his clan, Grigori has now entered the service of the Brujah Herleva and gained some clout in Arbanon, securing himself a good population to torture."
