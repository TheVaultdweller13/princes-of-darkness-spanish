 pod1230objectives_mummy.2.desc: "Horus long and bloody war against his uncle Set has been going on for centuries. Despite many setbacks and few precious victories, those truly faithful to the Avenger never gave up on restoring balance to this world.\nHorus himself was sometimes gone from his disciples, having his own tasks to accomplish. This is when you stepped up to the great challenge in front of you.\nLeading the Shemsu-Heru as a disciplined and effective force, you achieved victories that even Horus himself only dreamed of. Osiris' son is no fool though and acknowledged your accomplishments naming you his Divine Vizier and giving you great praise and greater expectations for the future. You are now the prized lieutenant of the Chosen of Ma'at and the servants of the Serpent will learn to fear your name."

 pod1230objectives_mummy.5.desc: "While shen battle one another for trinkets of jade, the Yama Kings poison hearts on all sides, playing every end against the middle so that only hell wins.\nMore than breaking up a few fights, however, emissaries of the Wu Feng recruit other noble shen to their cause, from the ferocious hengeyokai shapeshifters to the hidden godlings of the hsien. Life is precious, too precious to be wasted in pointless infighting. Peace brings hope, hope brings healing, healing brings life. In all of these things, hell is defeated."
 pod1230objectives_mummy.5.a: "Hell will fall."

 pod1230objectives_mummy.6.t: "The Horus Question"
 pod1230objectives_mummy.6.desc: "Horus, the leader of the mummies devoted to the fight against Set, took it personally when some of them (including you) decided to give up on this battle. While his forces are often stretched too thin to be a threat, he is still one of the powerful entities active in the world. As such, you have been preparing a show of force to push the stubborn Egyptian to the table of negotiations.\nKnowing Horus, he will only agree to listen if he considers that punishing you (and your kind) would amount to too much effort that could be better spent fighting his uncle Set.\nWith this preparation out of the way, it remains to be seen how the actual negotiations conclude..."

 pod1230objectives_mummy.7.t: "Balance of Ma'at"
 pod1230objectives_mummy.7.desc: "The Judges of Ma'at are a group of beings that enforce the cosmic principle of Ma'at and judge the advancement of Balance of a Mummy when they die and return to Anubis who the guides the mummy towards the Judges. Should they found a mummy wanting, they would strip it of its power and could even destroy it by casting the mummy's soul into Amemait. Their true natures and names are unknown, as this would let them left controllable by the means of magic and Hekau. Egyptian priests codified the known names and described the judges' responsibilities and origins as well as they could. Being mere mortals, the priests often transcribed grossly simplified or misunderstood concepts of what principles of Ma'at each entity represented.\nMy devotion to Amenti is well known, and with my understanding of Hekau I could become one of the [GetTrait('judge_of_maat').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]. Originally, each Judge had an associated Shemsu-Heru whom he watched and judged in his deeds. With the spread of the Spell of Life, this functions scattered, and your purview will now be much wider than simply watching over one single entity."
 pod1230objectives_mummy.7.a: "A much greater responsibility."

 pod1230objectives_mummy.8.t: "Separation from Ma'at"
 pod1230objectives_mummy.8.desc: "Created by Isis and maintained by her husband Osiris, the Spell of Life who gave immortality to the mummies has always been tied deeply to the Ancient Egyptians beliefs. As such, they have to follow these ancient customs and pay proper homage to the guardians of this long dead land.\nThere might be another way however. Cabirus, when he stole the Spell of Life for his own use, tried to tie the ritual to his own pantheon and customs of his native Ancient Greece. While only partially successful, this was still a promising example of what could be achieved. With your own tremendous control over your own form and necromantic abilities, it is time to surpass this earlier effort and cut yourself from Ma'at for good. Which realm of the dead will your new mummies be reborn in?"

 pod1230objectives_mummy.8.b: "Hellheim"
