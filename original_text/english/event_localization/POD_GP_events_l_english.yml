 podgreatpersons.0001.t: "Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi"
 podgreatpersons.0001.desc: "A renowned historian and philosopher, Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi has recently moved back to Baghdad after years of extensive travels across the Middle East. His writings and knowledge of the soul, mind and body of humans are already being held in great value, and even Saladin himself gave him patronage. As he grows older and more reclusive, it might be your only chance of acquiring such a fine childe for yourself."
 podgreatpersons.0001.a: "Gold is of no concern."
 podgreatpersons.0001.b: "It is time to pull some strings."
 podgreatpersons.0001.c: "We are better off without another competitor."
 podgreatpersons.0001.d: "Just give it to me!" 
 podgreatpersons.0001.custom: "This Great Person will join your court, giving you the opportunity to use their skills, or tailor them for future use like the [Embrace|E] (if you are a vampire). Messing with such an individual will increase your $pod_masquerade_exposure$ if you are a vampire however."
 podgreatpersons.0001.customb: "You don't try to influence this Great Person. A close by vampire ruler will probably jump at the opportunity to [Embrace|E] them."
 podgreatpersons.0002.t: "Alice Kyteler"
 podgreatpersons.0002.desc: "A quaint little story has come to your attention. One crafty mortal named Alice Kyteler has recently escaped her trial for witchcraft, heresy, animal sacrifice and fornication with a demon seemingly named 'Robin'. All her associates have either already been burnt at the stake or soon will be, but she managed to thwart the Church on so many occasions that her ability can't be denied. As one of your contacts informs you that she has taken refuge close to your domain, you wonder if you'd fancy having an ambitious and clever witch as a childe..."
 podgreatpersons.0003.t: "Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi"
 podgreatpersons.0003.desc: "An accomplished jurist and theologian, Rumi as he is more widely known, is made even more famous by his Ghazals, or Persian poems. A widely beloved man, even outside of Muslim communities, he has recently finished his masterpiece, the Masnavi. News is that illness is catching up to him, and that he has predicted his own death. You have a small window to act if you want to [Embrace|E] him be it for patronizing his future works or for more... Cainitic related endeavors."
 podgreatpersons.0004.t: "Agnes Randolph"
 podgreatpersons.0004.desc: "As the mortal war for Scottish independence rages on, the name Agnes Dunbar has come to your attention. This fierce Scot has defended her leaderless castle with a spirit as indomitable as any mortal can muster. Turning 20,000 Englishmen in ridicule with clever tricks and a quick wit, the lady of the castle has more than proven her mettle. Stuck in a loveless marriage with few prospects of any inheritance, you could probably convince such a brave woman to put her considerable skills to your service. Perhaps even as a childe..."
 podgreatpersons.0005.t: "Agnes Sorel"
 podgreatpersons.0005.desc: "You have just been informed that Louis XI, the son of the mortal king of France is planning to poison Agnes Sorel, the Royal Mistress. This often scandalous lady has been a strong influence on the king for a while now and tales of her beauty have even reached your court. If you don't act fast, France will lose one of its most beautiful flowers. If you do however... well, perhaps you can make sure that this specific flower never withers."
 podgreatpersons.0006.t: "Alexander Nevsky?"
 podgreatpersons.0006.desc: "In a surprising turn of events, you have heard that someone claiming to be Alexander Nevsky has recently shown up in a nearby town. It is unlikely at best, since the famed Grand Prince of Vladimir is currently on a diplomatic mission with the Golden Horde. This individual claims to have learned of [cainite|E] society and wishes to be 'embraced on his own terms' to gain immortality, but not enslavement. You have doubts about this story but can you let a rival potentially [Embrace|E] the Hero of the Rus, bane of Germans and Swedes alike? At the very least, you can make him come to your court and judge for yourself..."
 podgreatpersons.0007.t: "Anthony of Padua?"
 podgreatpersons.0007.desc: "One of your agents report that someone claiming to be Anthony of Padua, the famous holy man, has been seen in a nearby town. It is unlikely at best, since you are pretty sure that the real Anthony died last year, and was canonized by Rome. The real Franciscan monk was a living Saint, with an aura capable of burning your kind from miles away. Still... perhaps this is worth investigating. He could be one of his companions still alive or a man learned enough to warrant considering as a potential childe."
 podgreatpersons.0008.t: "Antonio de Nebrija"
 podgreatpersons.0008.desc: "One of the greatest humanists of the era, Antonio de Nebrija has authored many books that your court often references. You are not particularly keen on this 'humanism' fad that the mortals are having right now but you can't deny the talent of this man. His age is catching up to him though, and you wonder if now would be the right time to bring him closer to your court. Perhaps having a 'modern minded' childe of your own could prove beneficial."
 podgreatpersons.0009.t: "Baba Ishak Kafarsurdi"
 podgreatpersons.0009.desc: "A mortal has made quite a ruckus in northeastern Anatolia recently. Proclaiming himself an immortal Messiah, this Ishak has gathered many followers and even led open rebellion against the Seljuk Sultanate. As is often the case with mortals though, this was a short lived attempt and the so called 'Immortal' is soon going to be executed. You consider that this man doesn't lack in charisma and drive. Perhaps with the proper teacher, he could make an interesting childe..."
 podgreatpersons.0010.t: "Beatriz da Silva?"
 podgreatpersons.0010.desc: "Something happened in the palace of Toledo dedicated to the new order of the Immaculate Conception. Reports are hazy, but your agents claim that they finally have been able to approach the place despite the aura of True Faith around it. They followed survivors of what looks like an attack by unknown parties and think they have a good handle on the order foundress -Beatriz da Silva's- location after the event. It seems far fetched, especially since Da Silva must be far too holy for $pod_cainites$ to approach but still, this is an opportunity. You could track this woman down and bring her to you. You might have a use for her..."
 podgreatpersons.0011.t: "Birgitta Birgersdotter?"
 podgreatpersons.0011.desc: "Knowing of your reputation, a young woman claiming to be Birgitta Birgersdotter has come to one of your agents asking to be 'freed from the trappings of the Church'. Your men say that there are similarities between this woman and what is known of the holy woman about to found a new holy order in Sweden, but the age doesn't match. With a little digging, you can safely say that this is one of her daughters, Cecilia, who was stuck in a convent against her will at a young age by her saintly mother. Although not as big as a prize as Birgitta herself, Cecilia still looks like a potentially useful and determined young woman. Potentially a suitable candidate for [Embrace|E]?"
 podgreatpersons.0012.t: "Catherine of Siena?"
 podgreatpersons.0012.desc: "You have heard of Catherine of Siena, a young holy woman having made a name for herself as a traveling force of God, perhaps the most ardent advocate for the Church of Rome currently active, even if seeming at odds sometimes. As such, you were surprised when another woman surfaced recently, claiming to be the presumed dead sister of Catherine, Bonaventura. It seems she has survived thus far with methods better left unsaid and wishes now to disappear from History, as her 'death' was a profound guiding lesson for Catherine. It is an unusual request, as it seems the woman is still quite fervent in her love for God and her sister, but not enough to take her own life. You ponder your next move."
 podgreatpersons.0013.t: "Clare of Assisi?"
 podgreatpersons.0013.desc: "A minor rival of yours has made a daring move against San Damiano, the Church where the holy Clare of Assisi is dwelling with her sisters in faith. Obviously, the fool and his cronies didn't survive the True Faith permeating the area, but they managed to cause quite a commotion. It appears that one of Clare's sisters, Beatrix, was 'lost' during the assault. Although you stand no chance against the pious and virtuous Clare herself, embracing her sister would be a moral blow to the Church..."
 podgreatpersons.0014.t: "Cesare Borgia"
 podgreatpersons.0014.desc: "Cesare Borgia, the ruthless Italian, is currently leading a difficult siege in Viana. The man has proved himself immensely resourceful so far, with many victories, and betrayals, to his name during his campaigns in Italy. With the death of his father Rodrigo and the ascent of a new, hostile Pope, he is starting to get cornered by his many enemies. There would be no better time to make a move if you wish a prestigious childe of your own. After all, anything can happen during a siege..."
 podgreatpersons.0015.t: "Christine de Pizan"
 podgreatpersons.0015.desc: "A common sight in French courts for decades, the famous writer and teacher Christine du Pizan has recently moved to a convent for the last years of her mortal life. Her work has received high praise in many circles, including [cainite|E], as they dwell on the true definition of rulership, optimistic views on the future and the place of women in France's history. Her body might be weakening, but her mind seems as sharp as ever, as she has recently published a poem on Joan of Arc's destiny. Some courtiers of yours fancy the idea of making her a part of [cainite|E] society. For safekeeping of her talent, of course."
 podgreatpersons.0016.t: "Cola di Rienzo"
 podgreatpersons.0016.desc: "Mortal Rome has been in an even greater uproar than usual as of late. The main cause being one Cola di Rienzo, a commoner having managed to become leader of the city by sheer charisma... twice. He dreams of a new Roman Empire, clearly infatuated with his own delusions of grandeur. The man also seems quite meek when it comes to warfare and is easily bullied. Your agents are doubtful if he is really talented or just insanely lucky. The fact is that the Roman mob is clearly turning against him now, an opportunity for you to [Embrace|E] an unlikely, but perhaps useful, childe."
 podgreatpersons.0017.t: "Dante Alighieri"
 podgreatpersons.0017.desc: "Although your court and your peers don't understand it, you have become quite fond of a recently published epic called 'the Divine Comedy'. It has... something that reaches deep into your soul, especially in your condition, as if the author knew more than a mortal should about Gods and Demons. This man, Dante Alighieri, is quite down on his luck now, having been exiled and forsaken by most of his old political allies. It is unlikely that anyone would mind if he was to meet some unfortunate accident... And then, you could bring him to your court and have the answers you seek. After all, an immortal life should be enough time to understand the Divine."
 podgreatpersons.0018.t: "Diane de Poitiers"
 podgreatpersons.0018.desc: "Diane de Poitiers has been the true power behind the throne of France for almost 25 years now. As far as you can tell, she hasn't really plotted or killed her way into this position... which would have made her a perfect [Embrace|E] candidate. Still, you don't get to be this powerful in France without an astute intellect and a good deal of political sense, both qualities the Royal Favourite have aplenty. With the recent death of Henry II, her main rival, Catherine de Medici, has already moved in to remove all the power and assets given to her by the king. Diane doesn't seem bent on retaliating and appears to accept her fate of falling into obscurity. It could be a good time to secure yourself a chief advisor of your own..."
 podgreatpersons.0019.t: "Edward Longshanks?"
 podgreatpersons.0019.desc: "The last king of England, Edward I, died four years ago. You followed his life with interest, as he was a renowned lawmaker, shrewd politician and capable general, all qualities prized in [cainite|E] society... with just a touch of fear and brutality of course, also qualities possessed by the late king. Embracing him was always out of the question, as protected by agents of the Church as kings are, but you recently heard that Henry of Lacy, his most trustworthy companion is showing signs of leaving his mortal coil. A loyal and capable man himself, he could make for a good witness of Longshanks' tactics, or even an [Embrace|E] candidate."
 podgreatpersons.0020.t: "Erzsebet Bathory"
 podgreatpersons.0020.desc: "One of your agents returned from castle Csejte with a troubling report, it seems that Erzsebet Bathory, the woman accused of more than 600 murders, bathing in the blood of virgins and cannibalism, isn't actually a vampire... yet. Her trial was a merciless affair, even capable of troubling the most resilient [cainite|E] with detailed accounts of her torture practices which include burning, freezing, using live ants or eviscerating. Sometimes all of them at once. But if she isn't a vampire... that means that she would make an excellent, if perhaps a little unhinged, [Embrace|E] candidate."
 podgreatpersons.0021.t: "Elizabeth of Hungary?"
 podgreatpersons.0021.desc: "A minor rival of yours recently made a move against Konrad von Marburg, a renowned inquisitor and erstwhile mentor of the recently departed Saint Elizabeth of Hungary. The fool was crushed, but the aftermath is messy, with trails leading to more clues about the '[cainite|E] Conspiracy'. One of those is a young woman, another pupil of the inquisitor, who witnessed first hand the gifts of Caine. Making her disappear would cause suspicion but could be useful, both as a strike against the Inquisition and as a potential [Embrace|E] candidate. Strangely enough, the woman is also named Elizabeth and seems close to the age the Saint should be at this point. Perhaps Konrad has secrets of his own..."
 podgreatpersons.0022.t: "Ernst von Manfeld"
 podgreatpersons.0022.desc: "Your agents report that Ernst von Manfeld, the infamous mercenary leader is currently in Bosnia, apparently in a state of terminal illness. This crafty German has made a name for himself as a skilled, if not overtly reliable, man for hire. He is quite renowned for having fought on the Protestant side during the Thirty Years War... despite considering himself a devout Catholic. With his excellent military pedigree and... open mindedness, he could make for an interesting [Embrace|E] candidate."
 podgreatpersons.0023.t: "Eustace Folville"
 podgreatpersons.0023.desc: "The so called 'Folville' gang has been the talk of England for decades now. Probably not much better than mere thugs, these outlaws had the good fortune, or the ability, of targeting members of Edward II's entourage. The king, as despised as he is, can't really convince anyone that Eustace's gang isn't some sort of popular band of heroic figures. After many years of research, your agents have finally tracked down the aging outlaw. You are now able to potentially acquire an able fighter and rabble-rouser for yourself."
 podgreatpersons.0024.t: "Fibonacci"
 podgreatpersons.0024.desc: "A new fad is coming over the mortals. The 'Hindu-Arabic' numeral system is starting to be used over the older -and obviously superior in your opinion- Roman one. You are pretty sure the mortals will come to their senses in due time but you are curious about the proponent of this theory, one Leonardo Bonacci, also known as Fibonacci. The now old man has settled in Pisa after publishing his treatise. You can't deny the man's knowledge and you could 'invite' him to your court for a debate. Or perhaps for more... familial purposes?"
 podgreatpersons.0025.t: "Florian Geyer"
 podgreatpersons.0025.desc: "The mortal Peasants' War has been an annoying thorn in your side for some time now as feeding becomes harder to obtain when peasants are dying by the droves in a war. An opportunity has presented itself though in the form of Florian Geyer, the disgraced noble leading the 'Black Company,' a unit of heavy cavalry who fought alongside the peasants. Although already a popular hero to the common people, Geyer is also ruthless and quick to anger making him a loose cannon in the wild. And it so appears that, after their last defeat at Ingolstadt, your agents were able to pinpoint his location. Cornered and on the losing side of History, it's only a matter of time before Geyer faces death. But if you were to intervene..."
 podgreatpersons.0026.t: "Galeazzo Maria Sforza"
 podgreatpersons.0026.desc: "These last years you have been entertained by the tales of one Galeazzo Maria Sforza, the mortal duke of Milan. A man with vivid imagination, he has created many new forms of torture, both psychological and physical. Your court was particularly amused by the 'nail a man alive to his coffin' one. Obviously, this hasn't really made him many friends in Milan and beyond, and it stands to reason to think he will soon be removed from power, probably violently. You are entertaining the idea of staging his death yourself, to then bring him back to your court. At the very least, he could make for a very lively vampire..."
 podgreatpersons.0027.t: "Geoffrey Chaucer"
 podgreatpersons.0027.desc: "You have heard that the famous poet and civil servant, Geoffrey Chaucer, has been ambushed by bandits and wounded during the attack. The man isn't young anymore and his glory days have passed with his patron Richard II's abdication. Still, he is an able diplomat and a prodigious poet, one of the first using the Middle English language as a literary device. Such a learned person in both politics and poetry warrants a degree of appeal as a prospective childe."
 podgreatpersons.0028.t: "Gilles de Rais"
 podgreatpersons.0028.desc: "One of Joan of Arc's companions, Gilles de Rais, has fallen quite low recently. Having lost his fortune and any goodwill from his peers, the nobleman seems to have resorted to more... demonic patrons. His trial has been a sordid affair, with testimonies of murders with a degree of cruelty that even most $pod_cainites$ would find distasteful. The veracity of the accusations are hard to acknowledge since, after all, even mortals plot against each other. It remains that Gilles will face death by hanging very soon... unless you were to intervene and replace him with another poor soul. For a human, Gilles has certainly shown potential as an [Embrace|E] candidate..."
 podgreatpersons.0029.t: "Girolamo Savonarola"
 podgreatpersons.0029.desc: "Florence has been in an uproar recently, when one Dominican friar, Savonarola, ousted the ruling Medici by preaching the good people visions of glory, for them, and ruin, for their enemies. This man has proven resilient, resisting excommunication attempts by the Church and even placating the king of France into a pseudo-alliance. His luck has run out as of late though, as he botched the trial by fire meant to prove his divine calling to the people of Florence. Now held in prison by an angry mob and lacking any support, the one time de facto ruler of Florence will face death by fire very soon... unless you were to intervene. Certainly, Savonarola has talent in making people follow him and that is a valuable quality to have in [cainite|E] politics."
 podgreatpersons.0030.t: "Gottfried von Berlichingen"
 podgreatpersons.0030.desc: "The mercenary leader Gottfried -Gotz- von Berlichingen has became the talk of your court lately. The wrathful and foul mouthed German is known to hold grudges for a very long time and even more famously known for having lost his arm during a siege. A fact that has not stopped Gotz for long, as he promptly used a strange iron device to replace it and go back to the battlefield. After a long career of wars, captures and injuries, the 'Iron Hand' is finally starting to show his age and has returned to his family estate to spend his final days in peace. Your court argues that such a tenacious and experimented individual would be a great asset to your undoubtedly just cause as a ruler of the night."
 podgreatpersons.0031.t: "Hadewijch"
 podgreatpersons.0031.desc: "Word has reached you of a traveling noblewoman named Hadewijch passing through your city. Although their inquiry didn't reveal much about her past, your agents describe her a skilled poetess and writer with the look of someone who has faced much during her life, but still endures. This strong personality and learned background makes her someone worth watching over, and perhaps even worth considering as an [Embrace|E] candidate."
 podgreatpersons.0032.t: "Hermann von Salza"
 podgreatpersons.0032.desc: "The Grandmaster of the Teutonic Order has been a massive headache for the $pod_cainites$ in Germany since the start of his tenure. Even the Black Cross, the order of German [cainite|E] knights, could not pierce the True Faith shielding this man. As such, and with his impressive talents as both a commander and a diplomat, Hermann has been able to curb most [cainite|E] influence on his order. Something has changed recently though, as the Teutonic knights have enacted a silent rebellion pushing him to the sidelines as a mere figurehead. As old age catches up with him and his life's work crumbles, Hermann's faith is dwindling. This could be the best opportunity for some sweet ironic revenge on this soldier of the Church..."
 podgreatpersons.0033.t: "Ibn Arabi"
 podgreatpersons.0033.desc: "One of the most famous learned man of the Muslim world has recently moved to Damascus. Ibn Arabi is a renowned scholar, mystic and philosopher with almost 850 works attributed to him. Even the [cainite|E] world has taken notice, with various debates springing up about his true knowledge of the inner workings of the world. Now an old man, it seems Ibn Arabi is frantically trying to finish his second draft of the Futuḥat al-Makkiyya before death catches up to him. Granting the gift of immortality to such an individual is tempting, even if you know that the curse of Cain can profoundly change a person..."
 podgreatpersons.0034.t: "Ibn Khaldun"
 podgreatpersons.0034.desc: "The renowned scholar, politician and historian Ibn Khaldun is, once again, threatened by his numerous enemies. The old adventurer has experienced a life of schemes, military conquests and many prestigious government positions. Still, he is best known for his remarkable work on the cyclical nature of empires which has made him one of the envoys sent to parlay with the threatening Mongol lord Timur. Having returned recently, his allegiance to a secret political party is coming back to haunt him and his days appear numbered, both by his propensity for trouble and old age. Some of your courtiers urge you to consider him as a potential childe before it is too late."
 podgreatpersons.0035.t: "Imperia Cognita"
 podgreatpersons.0035.desc: "The 'Queen of Courtesans' has been a welcome sight in Rome since her arrival. A shrewd woman, she managed to claw her way to the top of Rome's most famous celebrities, the courtesans. Adored by both the clergy and artists, such as Raphael, she is a wealthy and influential presence in the Holy City. It seems this is coming to an end though, as she is currently fighting, and losing, a battle against poison apparently self administered. Although you aren't sure why she tried to kill herself, perhaps a petty mortal reason like 'true love', you know that this is an opportunity to [Embrace|E] one that should easily find her place in the courts of the night."
 podgreatpersons.0036.t: "Jan Hus?"
 podgreatpersons.0036.desc: "The 'Hussite movement' has been a major concern for $pod_cainites$ recently. Some are enthralled at the idea of the Church falling into pieces, others seem genuinely interested in this reformist theory. The head of the movement, Jan Hus himself, isn't long for the world though, as his trial will very likely result in his prompt execution. One group of young 'Hussite' $pod_cainites$ has mounted a daring rescue of the prisoner... and failed miserably. In the aftermath though, your agents took notice of a lone man wandering the streets, claiming to be the preacher himself. It is very unlikely, as the trial is continuing smoothly, but he might be a disciple of Hus, shocked by the attack. In any case, as a survivor of a [cainite|E] assault, he is a threat to your continued secrecy..."
 podgreatpersons.0037.t: "Jan Zizka"
 podgreatpersons.0037.desc: "You have been closely following the career of one brilliant general named Jan Zizka. This Hussite leader has proven immensely capable, turning a ragtag band of peasants into a force capable of defeating Europe's best knights using innovative tactics. Most notably with the advent of what is known as 'gunpowder', a deadly new weapon that could cause issues for your kind. You have learned that Zizka is once again on campaign, but the plague has caught up to him, and his days seem numbered. You strongly consider mounting an operation to bring him to your court as he would be a valued military leader and someone who could explain to you first hand the danger of these new weapons."
 podgreatpersons.0038.t: "Madame de Pompadour"
 podgreatpersons.0038.desc: "France has a long tradition of powerful mistresses and confidantes for her kings. But you must admit that what you have been told of Jeanne Antoinette Poisson is out of the ordinary. The royal mistress, then 'friend of the king' when they moved on to a more chaste relationship, has had as much power as Louis XV in recent years, if not more. Her charisma, political acumen and solid network of friends has made her powerful... and hated in many circles of the court. This is coming to an end though, as her frail constitution has finally won over her resolve, with a disease she probably won't survive. Mortal France will lose a jewel, but perhaps [cainite|E] France could win one..."
 podgreatpersons.0039.t: "Jeanne de Clisson"
 podgreatpersons.0039.desc: "Your agents inform you that the infamous 'Lioness of Brittany' and her children have recently shipwrecked in a remote area. The Lioness is Jeanne de Clisson, a Breton noblewoman who has sworn revenge on the French king for the cowardly execution of her husband more than 10 years ago. Since then, she has been privateering with surprising success against the French fleets near Brittany. A willful and practical woman, she is known to leave only one survivor each time to tell the tale, she has impressed many of your courtiers. Her recent defeat and isolation from her allies and crewmates gives you an opportunity to 'invite' her to your court. Perhaps you could use such a Lioness as a childe..."
 podgreatpersons.0040.t: "Jeanne d'Arc?"
 podgreatpersons.0040.desc: "The 'Maid of Orleans' has been a major issue for $pod_cainites$ as the war rages on between France and England. What was a major opportunity for easy scheming and easier feeding has turned into an almost religious war. True Faith runs rampant, and you have lost count of the number of $pod_cainites$ burned by the zealots flocking to Jeanne's banner. She is herself unassailable, protected by a conviction that looks divine in nature but... her close relatives aren't. It is petty but you could take revenge on her family for all the headache she's caused, especially as the English have finally caught her, rendering her, hopefully, harmless. And with a little luck, they could even make useful pawns."
 podgreatpersons.0041.t: "John Cabot"
 podgreatpersons.0041.desc: "This is a time of change and exploration, two things that $pod_cainites$ aren't suited to handle. As Europe launches more and more expeditions into the great unknown, your kind wonders what manner of horrors, and opportunities, await them. You are determined to not be left behind and, as such, have made inquiries about one of the greatest explorers of the age, John Cabot. This stalwart ship captain has recently came back from one of his many trips to the great west and could probably do many more with an immortal patron such as yourself. Granting him immortality is also an option, one that could give you quite a headstart on the future, both here and beyond the vast blue ocean."
 podgreatpersons.0042.t: "John Hawkwood"
 podgreatpersons.0042.desc: "The Condottieri are a fact of life in Italy. These men are payed to wage war for the rich city states of the country and are often as fickle in allegiance as they are greedy for coins. One of their leaders, the English John Hawkwood, has made most of his career here, fighting for and against many cities. A ruthless and greedy man by most accounts, he is also acclaimed as one of the best commanders and strategists of the lot. As his age is catching up to him, and what should be his last expedition done, some of your courtiers argue that this would be a good time to approach him. The promise of immortality would easily seduce such a man and he could prove useful... if you could bind him to your will."
 podgreatpersons.0043.t: "Leonardo da Vinci"
 podgreatpersons.0043.desc: "For some time now, Francis I has grown quite fond of an Italian artist, even going as far as giving him a castle for his personal use. You have spied on the man and must acknowledge the sheer genius in multiple fields he possesses. You are far from the only one admiring him though, with what looks like a cabal of willworkers keeping close watch, making any close contact impossible. Recently though, you have learned that Leonardo's health is failing, pushing the king to schedule a visit to his old friend. This might be your best chance at 'inviting' the greatest mind of this generation to your court..."
 podgreatpersons.0044.t: "Lucrezia Borgia"
 podgreatpersons.0044.desc: "You are always on the lookout for potential [Embrace|E] candidates, and the Borgia family has no shortage of those. Lucrezia, daughter of Pope Alexander VI, has been quite an asset for her father and brother. Fair, intelligent and strong willed, she is the perfect Renaissance princess. The rumors of poisoning and ruthless intrigue surrounding her are a plus in your book, since it would make her even more suited for undeath. Your agents are awaiting your word."
 podgreatpersons.0045.t: "Marco Polo"
 podgreatpersons.0045.desc: "The [cainite|E] world is large and you are always keen on learning more about what strange friends, or most likely foes, you could make abroad. An opportunity has arisen with one Venetian merchant named Marco Polo. Allegedly, the man who is having a quiet family life right now has traveled as far as Cathay for several decades. It is likely that he has picked up some interesting information or clues about the night world abroad during this time. Obviously, you could just read his notes, but you could also do far better than that... Your agents are ready to make a visit to the Polo estate at your command."
 podgreatpersons.0046.t: "Margaret I"
 podgreatpersons.0046.desc: "For almost 20 years now, Burgundy and Flanders have been ruled by Margaret Capet. The early death of her husband, and her strong influence on her child have made her a force to be reckoned with in the area. Strong willed, she isn't the kindest of rulers, as can attest the numerous rebellions that have risen, and been crushed, during her reign. Still, she is a capable stateswoman with a mind capable of enduring the rigors of undeath and, as such, you are considering a daring operation to [Embrace|E] her before death claims her."
 podgreatpersons.0047.t: "Michael Scot"
 podgreatpersons.0047.desc: "The science adviser and court astrologer of Emperor Frederick II is a strange Englishman named Michael Scot. This evidently learned individual is often accused of black magic since he seems to know more about the inner workings of the world that anyone should. As far as you can tell though, he is not possessed by any supernatural force... yet. His knowledge of Heaven and God is of special interest to you, a being cursed by the Creator himself, and you wonder if Scot could be an asset in this endeavor. Separating him from the Emperor's court and faking his death as an accident wouldn't be easy, but it is in your power."
 podgreatpersons.0048.t: "Mindaugas"
 podgreatpersons.0048.desc: "Mortal Lithuania is slowly converting to Christianity, as many eastern countries have done before. Here, the process is bloody and unforgiving though, with the native religions fighting against the holy orders. A turning point has perhaps been reached with the crowning of Mindaugas, the first king of Lithuania, with his baptism into the Church. Far from a zealot though, he has already changed religions several times as he battled the Tatars and rival dukes for the crown. While no doubt cynical, Mindaugas has accomplished much militarily and administratively and so, when you learn of a mortal plot to kill him for petty revenge, you consider your options. Embracing a king is always risky, but his power base is weak enough that you could be successful."
 podgreatpersons.0049.t: "Niccolo Machiavelli"
 podgreatpersons.0049.desc: "You have been fascinated by a manuscript recently gifted to you. 'The Prince' is a perfect study of [cainite|E] politics and rulership... and it was written by a mere mortal! This Machiavelli is far from receiving the fame you think he deserves, with his masterpiece being torn apart over petty concerns of 'morality' and 'just rule'. If mortals can't appreciate the genius behind this work, you could certainly offer him a better deal. An immortality deal..."
 podgreatpersons.0050.t: "Nicolaas Zannekin"
 podgreatpersons.0050.desc: "Flanders has been plagued by peasant revolts for several years now. It is certainly an opportunity for $pod_cainites$ since, after all, feeding is much easier during times of war. This specific revolt is strangely enduring, as far as mortal feuds go, and surprisingly successful with the capture of several towns and the count himself. You have no doubt that it will be crushed in time but... this endurance is the sign of a good leader ordering the peasants around. Perhaps you could have some agents of yours 'inquire' about the rebel leader during the next battle..."
 podgreatpersons.0051.t: "Nikephoros Blemmydes"
 podgreatpersons.0051.desc: "The fall of Constantinople has seen the loss of many great scholars. Some, though, have been able to thrive in the chaotic aftermath, like Nikephoros Blemmydes. A teacher, writer and theologian, he has taken residence in Nikaea where the emperor offers him ample patronage. He has already taught many great figures, such as the prince, and is considering retiring to live his later life in the serene peace of a monastery. Such beacons of late Roman culture are becoming increasingly rare as the fortune of the empire dwindles. As such, you are considering gifting him immortality, to preserve that one small piece of it at least."
 podgreatpersons.0052.t: "Pons de Capduelh"
 podgreatpersons.0052.desc: "The Crusades have been a terrible blow to the region you rule, but they have the advantage of bringing to you some interesting people. One Pons de Capduelh for example, a troubadour from Auvergne, has been the talk of your court for a while. A charming, optimistic fellow with a quick wit and quicker word, seems capable of enthralling even the most stern crusader in bold songs of love and chivalry. Such talent could certainly have its use in [cainite|E] politics, where a silver tongue can get you very far."
 podgreatpersons.0053.t: "Rodrigo Borgia"
 podgreatpersons.0053.desc: "The Papacy has always been a headache for vampires, the sheer power of the True Faith radiating from it making any inroads impossible. This has changed somewhat with the current Pope, Alexander VI, who seems much more preoccupied by earthly matters than any spiritual concerns. He has been quite successful at it too, extending the Papal States' area of influence and the power of his family through conquests and shrewd diplomacy. His less than stellar spirituality allows you a once in a immortal lifetime opportunity: You could send agents into the Holy See itself to 'save' Rodrigo Borgia, currently bedridden by a food intoxication, or poisoning. Then, once hidden in your court, you would have a Pope all to yourself..."
 podgreatpersons.0054.t: "Roi Xordo"
 podgreatpersons.0054.desc: "Galicia is a country in itself despite being ruled by the King of Castille. This isolated region is home to very autocratic rulers, even by the standards of the era. These nobles are often careless with the common populace and a boiling point was reached four years ago, with a revolt starting. The rebels are led by a minor Fidalgo -a lesser title of nobility- named Roi Xordo. The man has claimed some early successes but the wind is turning, as the more experienced troops of the nobility are cracking down hard on the rebellion. Although they seem doomed to fail, perhaps their leader could still be of some use to you. A passionate and militarily minded childe has its appeal..."
 podgreatpersons.0055.t: "Skanderbeg"
 podgreatpersons.0055.desc: "The Ottomans have been a major concern for Europe for a while now. The defeated crusade of Varna and the fall of Constantinople paved the way for further expansion on their part. But, for almost 25 years now, they have been thwarted by a man named Skanderbeg, who, with a paltry number of troops, has managed to halt the powerful Turk war machine. Already hailed as a hero across Europe, the elderly general is once again at the helm of a new coalition but a deadly illness has taken hold of him. With no hope of recovery, you are wondering if this would be a good time to 'save' him and bring him to your court. After all, it would be a shame to lose such a brilliant defender."
 podgreatpersons.0056.t: "Snorri Sturluson"
 podgreatpersons.0056.desc: "Iceland is a remote land, even for other Scandinavians, but it has come to your attention with the tale of one Snorri Sturluson, apparently the most powerful politician of the island. A scholar of Norse mythology, Snorri has navigated chaotic Icelandic and Norwegian politics for decades now but it seems that the King of Norway has had enough. One of your agents reports that an assassination plot is underway targeting the Icelandic lawmaker. It's of little concern to you, of course, but there is the option of saving Snorri and bringing him back to your court if you wish. He could make for an interesting candidate for the [Embrace|E]."
 podgreatpersons.0057.t: "Subutai"
 podgreatpersons.0057.desc: "The Mongol Horde has washed away all its enemies from China to Poland. Politically, Gengis Khan is certainly the main factor but militarily, Subutai, his main strategist, is the man behind the scenes. Having orchestrated more than 20 campaigns and won 65 battles, the loyal general is already famous throughout the Steppes. At the ripe age of 72, Subutai has finally decided to retire from the battlefield, offering you a golden opportunity to [Embrace|E] him without the prying eyes of a whole army."
 podgreatpersons.0058.t: "Teresa of Avila?"
 podgreatpersons.0058.desc: "Iberia has become quite uncomfortable for Vampires since the beginning of the Spanish Inquisition. You have tried many big and small schemes to reduce the Church influence and it was working quite well until Teresa of Avila came around. This stubborn nun has almost single handedly reformed and reignited the passion for Christianity in the mortal hearts of Iberia. You have put many obstacles in her way, including your agents in the Inquisition and the Church, to no avail. For now, you are letting the matter go and covering your tracks. The last step to do so is 'taking care' of your pet Papal Legate, Egidio Cajal, who has been fleeing your rage since his failure to stop her. But nobody escapes your reach for very long..."
 podgreatpersons.0059.t: "Theodore Metochites"
 podgreatpersons.0059.desc: "Roman politics are fickle and a man's fortune can easily turn. One such man is Theodore Metochites, the favorite of the late Emperor Andronikos II. A scholar, patron of the arts and renowned diplomat, Theodore owed most of his career to his personal talent, but also his friendship with the right people. When Andronikos was ousted from power, Metochites lost all credit at court and is now secluded in a monastery to live out the rest of his life. Some of your courtiers think that end is a criminal waste of a talented man, and you could intervene, perhaps recuperating a grateful prospective childe in the process."
 podgreatpersons.0060.t: "Theodora Palaiologina"
 podgreatpersons.0060.desc: "Constantinople has been reconquered by the Roman remnants after nearly 60 years of Latin rule. A period of arduous restoration is underway, heralded by the Empress herself, Theodora Palaiologina. A steadfast matriarch of the renewed Imperial family, she has weathered many political and religious storms. Her husband's early death left her in a position of relative power which she used to usher wise patronage and architectural works. She is a powerful symbol of the Greeks' return to power and you know that many of your rivals want to interfere with her. If you wish to act to have this symbol all for yourself, the time is now."
 podgreatpersons.0061.t: "Theodor von Neuhoff"
 podgreatpersons.0061.desc: "A colorful character has recently arrived in Zutphen. This man, Theodor von Neuhoff, is crippled by debts which he recovered from by selling his title as... King of Corsica. Indeed, following a short lived rebellion on the Genoese island, the inhabitants have 'crowned' this German adventurer as their prospective King. A tenure he only had for a couple of months before his 'Kingdom' broke into pieces. And now, here he is, not much more than a colorful conman having lost everything. At the very least though, he makes for a good tale. There have been worse prospective childer than one who could amuse you."
 podgreatpersons.0062.t: "Thibaut de Navarre"
 podgreatpersons.0062.desc: "Few individuals better represent the knightly ideals than Thibaut de Navarre does. He has lived through deadly intrigues (and orchestrated some), gone on a successful crusade, loved a forbidden woman (a Queen no less) and written many songs as a beloved 'Trouvere'. All the while, he also managed to climb the feudal hierarchy from Count of Champagne to King of Navarre where he had a successful reign. You have recently learned that, on the return from a trip to Champagne, Thibault has fallen gravely ill and his escort has slowed down. This might be an unique opportunity for your agents to 'save' the dying King and bring him to your court. An accomplished man such as himself is an interesting candidate for [Embrace|E]."
 podgreatpersons.0063.t: "Thomas Aquinas?"
 podgreatpersons.0063.desc: "One of your minor rivals has launched a reckless attack against a manor in Aquino. You are not entirely sure why, it seems that he had pawns in the family there, and that they have been thoroughly cleansed by one member of the household named Thomas. This learned man wants to join the Dominican Order and seems blessed by a superb intellect, already working on many new ideas for the Church. In any case, his True Faith burned your rival to a crisp and you are now left with a mess to contend with, since there have been many witnesses. Thomas himself is unassailable, but you could start by making his mother 'disappear'. Your agents think that the woman is actually a potential [Embrace|E] candidate, having used some underhanded tactics to achieve her goals in the past."
 podgreatpersons.0064.t: "Thomas Muntzer"
 podgreatpersons.0064.desc: "The Reformation is in full swing and if, as first, it appeared as a good thing for Vampires with the weakening of the Church, there are now even more Holy Men than ever before running around. Any efforts on your part to squash them have been inconclusive at best. One preacher named Thomas Muntzer is particularly giving you trouble with his creation of an 'Eternal league of God', mostly a growing number of rebellious peasants. His zealous talk of a coming Apocalypse is getting on your nerves and you are considering sending some of your agents during his next battle to bring him to your court. Then, you can show him the true face of Hell..."
 podgreatpersons.0065.t: "Timur?"
 podgreatpersons.0065.desc: "The Warlord known as Timur has been a major problem for you since he started his ruthless path of conquests. A self proclaimed inheritor of Genghis Khan's legacy, nobody has been able to stand in his way so far and his wars have resulted in countless cities pillaged and burned, which isn't really a good thing for a Vampire's hunting grounds. As [cainite|E] refugees start to cause trouble in your court, you consider a possible solution. So far, any attempts to capture or kill him have failed, as if he were protected by some supernatural force. An alternative course of action would be to abduct his favorite wife and closest advisor. With some luck, it could stall him a little. Worst case scenario, she is known to be talented and beautiful, two interesting qualities for a potential [Embrace|E]."
 podgreatpersons.0066.t: "Tomas de Torquemada"
 podgreatpersons.0066.desc: "The Inquisition has already been in full swing for quite some time in the world of the night. But, recently, it has gathered enough support to propagate itself in the mortal realm, with the Spanish Inquisition being officially recognized by the Pope. This has made the unlife of $pod_cainites$ in Iberia even harder and your subjects belittle you for not 'doing enough'. The Inquisition is way too powerful to take down now, but a surgical strike against its leader, Tomas de Torquemada, could be a moral victory you could capitalize on. Even more so if you could somehow [Embrace|E] him..."
 podgreatpersons.0067.t: "Ulrich von Liechtenstein"
 podgreatpersons.0067.desc: "A new fad is coming over these fickle mortals, 'Courtly Love' with tales of knights in shining armor and chaste romance with married ladies. As all things related to mortals, this will not survive the test of time but until then... it is always good to understand their current fancy. Your agents recommend the help of one Ulrich von Liechtenstein, a roaming knight and poet of some renown known as an exemplar of knighthood. The man has a silver tongue and a solid sword arm and could be useful to you in more ways than one."
 podgreatpersons.0068.t: "Vasco da Gama"
 podgreatpersons.0068.desc: "Contacts with Europe are increasing as of late, with the travels of one Portuguese explorer named Vasco da Gama. Although the man speaks of rich trade and grand alliances, his actions say otherwise. He has butchered the civilians of a traveling Muslim ship, and avenged himself with a full armada against a supposed slight by the King of Zamorin. It is clear now that the Portuguese are coming with a conqueror mindset and must be taught a lesson. Capturing and embracing the ruthless 'Viceroy of India' would serve as a warning to any European $pod_cainites$ trying to encroach upon your homeland."
 podgreatpersons.0069.t: "Wat Tyler"
 podgreatpersons.0069.desc: "There is an aura of anticipation about the result of the meeting between King Richard II and Wat Tyler, both hosting a peace conference of sorts between the nobles and the peasants' revolt. Tyler has been the most stubborn of the rebel leaders, refusing any concession made by the King so far. You are pretty sure that many important [cainite|E] figures are gathering in the shadows of the meeting, especially around Tyler's lover, one Patricia of Bollingbroke. As such, you are keen to send some of your own agents on site, to make sure you don't fall behind your rivals' schemes. The only thing left is the question of the freedom of action of your agents. Will you send them with resources and money enough to catch a 'prize' from the event, or just ordering them to watch?"
 podgreatpersons.0070.t: "William Wallace"
 podgreatpersons.0070.desc: "As the war for Scottish independence rages on, the Scots have lost one of their main commanders. William Wallace had fallen from favor after his defeat at Falkirk, but still remained one of the 'Guardians of Scotland' and a powerful symbol for his people. Elusive since Falkirk, Wallace has been seen traveling around Europe gathering support for his cause until his return to England, where he was recently captured. A trial has started, one where the verdict won't surprise anyone. The Scots will probably endure and rally behind their martyr but it would be a shame to lose such a determined man. You could pull some strings and arrange for a replacement before his execution. Then, he would be all yours..."
 podgreatpersons.0071.t: "Nagash"
 podgreatpersons.0071.desc: "A deranged old man has been making a fuss around Egypt lately. This individual claims to be the 'First Immortal' and Emperor of 'Nehekhara'. He tells that one of his spells has gone horribly wrong and landed him in 'our world'. The strange thing is, he knows about Vampires, even if he has some curious misconceptions about them (he is adamant that there are only 5 'bloodlines'). In any case, he is a liability, as he clearly is full of himself and could bring some unwanted attention on us. As such, you could send some of your agents to bring him to your court and deal with him yourself."
 podgreatpersons.0072.t: "Sa'ad al-Dawla"
 podgreatpersons.0072.desc: "A Jewish statesman has made himself known far and wide recently. Sa'ad has risen from humble origins, and his astonishing mastery over the affairs of the state has made him an invaluable asset in the court of the Mongolian Khan. Also famed for his wide medical knowledge and patronage of the arts, this Jewish Grand Vizier still has one big flaw: his arrogance.\nHis enemies are plentiful, from Mongolian officials flogged for corruption, to Muslims feeling hindered by a foreigner. Protected by the Khan, Sa'ad has so far remained one step ahead but his luck is running out, as his patron has recently fallen ill. The number of schemes started to murder him is even impressive by [cainite|E] standard. As such, if you want to act and remove him from mortal politics, it is now the time. Such a man would surely make for a good [Embrace|E] candidate."

Although the military situation seems to be resolving in favor of the Sultan, you are interested in the leader of the rebels.\nThis complex figure, Sheikh Bedreddin, is first and foremost a theologian preaching the communal ownership of propriety and the equality of Christians and Muslims. He is no slouch in military matters either, having been the chief military judge of the Ottoman Prince Musa.

This war has interested you due to the ruthless ambition of one belligerent, Alauddin Ali Shah.\nThis man, already ousted once from a position of power, has killed and usurped his current power base with a cold efficiency.

He has recently called his King a coward for fleeing in battle against the Ottoman Turks and is planning in continuing the war by himself. A brave, if suicidal, move.

The man has a long career, as he is determined to regain his rightful throne and even launched two invasions, causing panic in England.\nHis first fleet was prevented from landing by storms, while the second force was diverted to aid the king of France. When not invading Wales, Owain fought for the French in the Hundred Years War and commanded a company of Welsh mercenaries against Pedro the Cruel of Castille.\nHe has recently come to terms with the Castilian King, and plans a new invasion of his homeland with his help.

After a spell as a pirate, Roger saw a chance to secure his fortunes. He created a mercenary group, the Catalan company, from dismissed Aragonese soldiers.\nHe has since become an important force in Byzantine politics, as a successful mercenary captain against the Turks.

The leper’s gang surrounded the merchant’s house and demanded that he hand over the gems. The outraged merchant refused and stoutly beat off several attacks until Adam became exasperated and set the building on fire. Now the tables were turned, with the merchant and his family trying to get out and Adam keeping them in until they tossed out the jewels.\nThe now rich bandit was never caught since then... until your agents stumbled upon his lair, mostly by luck.\nThe aging outlaw has shown cunning and strength, and you are wondering if he could make a worthy childe."

In an impressive display of backstabbing, Momchil switched sides in 1343, 1344, and 1345.\nBy playing both sides, he was able to establish his own power in the borderlands.\nHe has become such a threat that Byzantines and Turks are now allied to deal with him once and for all. It seems unlikely that he will be able to resist such an assault.\nThe man has clearly demonstrated the raw ambition and guile needed to do well in vampiric society and, as such, your courtiers are urging you to consider sending someone to fake his death during the coming battle, then bring him to you."

After that, Arnaud largely went back to legitimate mercenary work.\nDuring his career, he has made many enemies, and as such has volunteered to join a Crusade far away from France.

 podgreatpersons.0093.t: "Ivan"
 podgreatpersons.0093.desc: "A young, apparently simpleminded, man has been the talk of your area recently. The youngest brother of his family, Ivan is always cheerful and kind to the point of foolishness. He is also often the (unwilling) hero of many tall tales, from dragons to kidnapped princesses, where he always somehow wins at the end.\nYou suspect a clever Malkavian prank as the real cause of this story, but what if Ivan was indeed gifted with extraordinary luck or another supernatural gift? You could bring him to your court to investigate at the very least."
 Kudeyar: "Kudeyar"
 podgreatpersons.0094.t: "Kudeyar"
 podgreatpersons.0094.desc: "Apparently the illegitimate elder brother of Ivan the Terrible, the man known as Kudeyar has quickly became a legend around your region. Leading a band of Cossacks near the Don River, his martial skills and fearless bravery have made him renowned throughout the land. The fact that he is targeting mostly nobles, or other not really popular figures, also help in crafting his image as a hero for the poor and the downtrodden. An impressive commander and skilled propagandist such as him could be of use to you."
 Ivan_Bolotnikov: "Ivan Bolotnikov"
 podgreatpersons.0095.t: "Ivan Bolotnikov"
 podgreatpersons.0095.desc: "The Time of Troubles are upon mortal Russia, and various warlords are competing against each other. One of them is a resourceful ex bishop, who escaped prisons and slavery several times before coming back as a rebel leader.\nIn these chaotic times though, he quickly shed any pretenses of fighting for anything but himself and was soon more feared than respected, especially after the destruction of several towns he orchestrated. Certainly a valuable quality if he was to join the world of the night. You have an opportunity to do just that actually, as he has recently surrendered and will probably soon face execution."
 Dmitri_Ivanovich: "Dmitri Ivanovich"
 podgreatpersons.0096.t: "Dmitri Ivanovich"
 podgreatpersons.0096.desc: "After an unsuccessful attack on Moscow, another warlord bites the dust as the Time of Troubles continues in Russia. This one made himself known as the lost son of Ivan the Terrible, which isn't very original, and somehow managed to gain enough credibility to amass an impressive army.\nHis military fortunes were mixed, but you most admired his capabilities of sticking to a lie as he was able to rally nobles and peasants alike behind his false banner. Perhaps you could make use of him? He certainly seems to have the necessary prerequisites to become an able, if not really trustworthy, childe."
 Alena_Arzamasskaia: "Alena Arzamasskaia"
 podgreatpersons.0097.t: "Alena Arzamasskaia"
 podgreatpersons.0097.desc: "Another peasant revolt is getting crushed in mortal Russia, but this one hold a special interest to you. One of the rebel leader was a fearsome woman, apparently an ex nun, who masqueraded as a man to lead her army. Her skills in both archery and medicine made her quite the foe, and she was only captured after shooting down a number of Tsarists in the convent where she took refuge.\nEven torture could not break her, and she will soon be burned at the stake while still not having betrayed her men. It would be a shame to lose such a promising mortal so soon and you ponder whether to interfere or not."
 Domentijan: "Domentijan"
 podgreatpersons.0098.t: "Domentijan"
 podgreatpersons.0098.desc: "A monk, scribe, writer and philosopher, Domentijan has been well appreciated by your court for some time, his works being discussed at length. Although quite fond of the monastical life, he is no recluse either, having worked for several courts and made his own pilgrimage to Jerusalem.\nSuch a learned and well traveled man could be an asset to your court, perhaps even a potential childe. As he is now quite old, it would be quite easy to fake his death if you so wished."
 Milos_Obilic: "Milos Obilic"
 podgreatpersons.0099.t: "Milos Obilic"
 podgreatpersons.0099.desc: "The Sultan of the Ottomans, Murad, has recently been assassinated on the battlefield by a fearless Serbian knight. Details are sketchy but the attack seems to have been a daring assault, perhaps with just a touch of deceit involved. You are on the lookout for potential [cainite|E] involvement but folk tales surrounding this new hero are already making it difficult to discern the truth.\nYou clearly doubt that he is a 'son of a dragon' or that he got help from, before slaying, Baba Yaga. One thing is for sure though, this man is a great fighter and is resourceful. Enough qualities for you to consider him as a potential [Embrace|E] candidate."
 Jefimija: "Jefimija"
 podgreatpersons.0100.t: "Jefimija"
 podgreatpersons.0100.desc: "An unhappy mother and sorrowful wife, Jefimija lost everything in her life... multiple times. Her son died an infant, her husband and brothers died in war, before her patron and her friend died in the same war later on. Then, her country got partitioned by Austrians and Ottomans.\nThese hardships proved to ber her inspiration though, and she created some very well received laments, a form of long and sad poetry. Your unbeating heart isn't easily moved nowadays, but this might be an exception. What does she still have to lose but her life now anyways?"
 Ivan_Gundulic: "Ivan Gundulic"

 podgreatpersons.0101.desc: "An accomplished diplomat and learned man of the Ragusan Republic, Deivo Franov Gundulic comes from a noble lineage that has been in your area for a long time now. This particular scion of theirs is a fervent Catholic, and is using his literary talent to help this cause. As a member of the city government, he also displays interesting capabilities in administrative skills.\nYou are considering making a move, such a man could be of use. Perhaps to write an inflammatory pamphlet against your rivals?"

 podgreatpersons.0102.t: "Giorgio da Sebenico"
 podgreatpersons.0102.desc: "An Italian master architect has been renovating the Sibenik Cathedral of St James for decades now. Clearly showing a skill and a patience very much unlike those fleeting mortals, you have been intrigued by this man and his work. Some look at his achievements and see inspiration from the divine and, although you have a much different relation with God than most mortals, you are also feeling something peculiar at least.\nWhile an architect isn't exactly the obvious career path you want for an [Embrace|E] candidate, there might be some merit into looking deeper this time. If nothing else, at least to renovate your probably quite antiquated interior."

 podgreatpersons.0103.t: "Marin Drzic"
 podgreatpersons.0103.desc: "One peculiar mortal has been captivating your court lately. After a career as an interpreter, scrivener and church musician, Marin Drzic lives the life of an adventurer, outlaw and comedy writer. Even more interesting, he is actually coming quite close to unearth the [cainite|E] presence in Dubrovnik.\nIndeed, your agents intercepted several letters from him addressed to the Medici of Firenze, asking them from help to get rid of the 'small elitist aristocracy that truly governs his city'. You are in no immediate danger but you can't deny that this mortal has proved his talents and his resourcefulness more than enough to, perhaps, warrant an audience with you.\nTime for him to meet these 'secret masters'."

 podgreatpersons.0104.t: "Rodion Oslyabya"
 podgreatpersons.0104.desc: "As the Russians celebrate their victory over the Mongols in the battle of Kulikovo, you have been made aware of the contributions of one of their commanders. This man, apparently a monk or a boyar himself, led the Russian knights with great courage and efficiency.\nUnhorsed, he was thought dead for a while, but reemerged during the battle and distinguished himself once again. His achievements have earned him the respect of the Russians leaders, and he is soon to depart to the Byzantine Empire for a diplomatic mission. You could interfere as such a zealous and charismatic general could certainly be of use to your plans."
 Alexander_Peresvet: "Alexander Peresvet"
 podgreatpersons.0105.t: "Alexander Peresvet"
 podgreatpersons.0105.desc: "You are casually following the news in the mortal world, and it seems that the Russians mortals are doing their best to free themselves from the Mongol's yoke. It is of little concern to you but war often breeds useful talent and, as such, your agents have been keeping an eye on things.\nTheir latest discovery was one Alexander Peresvet, a monk that fought a duel at the start of the recent battle against a Tatar champion. It ended in a draw, and your agents barely saved the mortal before the battle begun. Clearly, this warrior is a brave and committed soul as few are those willing to risk their lives as such. You could use him as a champion of your own, or perhaps even [Embrace|E] him."
 Ivan_Vyrodkov: "Ivan Vyrodkov"
 podgreatpersons.0106.t: "Ivan Vyrodkov"
 podgreatpersons.0106.desc: "Russia's days look grim for its mortals as Ivan the Terrible has instituted the Oprichnina, a policy of mass repression and execution to consolidate his rule. One of the potential victims is a man you are loathe to lose to petty mortals politics.\nIvan Vyrodkov has been the main military engineer of Russia for decades now and has invented new revolutionary designs like the battery tower. He is also credited of massive architectural feats in various cities, and constructing a 12 metre high siege tower in just one night. You could interfere and spare him Ivan the Terrible's wrath, resulting in a grateful and brilliant military engineer at your service."
 Yermak_Timofeyevich: "Yermak Timofeyevich"
 podgreatpersons.0107.t: "Yermak Timofeyevich"
 podgreatpersons.0107.desc: "As the nascent mortal Russian Empire is making its first conquests in Siberia, one man has been leading them: Yermak Timofeyevich, a cossack, adventurer and charismatic leader of men. Once a lowly thug and river pirate, his combat experience secured him a military post where he soon excelled. He was then chosen as the leader of the Siberian expedition and you have heard of his exploits and conquests ever since.\nDeath waits for no man though, and you also heard of a planned ambush by the Tatars that will probably cut short his career. It could be the perfect time to fake his death and introduce him to your court. Perhaps you too have uncharted lands to conquer."

 podgreatpersons.0108.t: "Ridolfo Fioravanti"
 podgreatpersons.0108.desc: "The whims of the powerful are sometimes petty indeed as you recently heard that Ivan III, ruler of mortal Russia, put his once favorite Italian architect in jail. Ridolfo Fioravanti comes from Bologna where he worked as one of the most sought after architects in Italy, before being invited to Moskow. Since then, he has been building the Dormition Cathedral and all was well until he had the audacity of asking the Tsar to come back to his native Italy for his last years.\nNot one to accept such injustice, you could rescue him from his cell... and bind him to be your eternal servant instead."

 podgreatpersons.0109.desc: "A monumental fresco painting of the Virgin Nativity Cathedral of the Ferapontov Monastery in Vologda Oblast has recently been unveiled to the public. A tremendous work that is the culmination of a strong career in icon painting by one man named Dionisius.\nHis creations are characterized by an aura of serenity and peace that seems to affect even the $pod_cainites$' raging inner Beasts. He is now old and tired though, and this was certainly his latest work.

One has distinguished himself recently.\nWilliam de Burgh, magnate and deputy justiciar, is a proven commander, having led his men both in victory and defeat. His strong diplomatic skills and unwavering loyalty to his Earl also kept the feuding families of Connacht in check during his tenure. Something that isn't easily done in the complicated politics of the Isle.\nWilliam caught a nasty disease recently and probably won't make it, which could be the occasion for you to 'invite' him to your court."

 podgreatpersons.0111.desc: "The last remnant of Viking Britannia, the Isle of Mann, has finally fallen to Scottish forces but the Northmen don't intent to go down easily. Led by the bastard son of the last King of the Isles, they prepared a rebellion and stormed the Scottish positions before being forced to a field battle.\nFaced with superior numbers, the rebels were soundly defeated but their leader, Godred Magnusson, managed to escape. Despite this setback, this 'last Viking' of Britannia has shown a strong temperament and ambition that could be useful.

 podgreatpersons.0113.t: "Julian Cesarini"
 podgreatpersons.0113.desc: "The last mortal Crusade against the Ottomans ended in chaos after the disastrous battle of Varna, but it also provided an enticing opportunity for you. The cardinal Julian Cesarini has been located by your agents, on his own and vulnerable.\nThis man has been the mastermind behind the Papacy's diplomatic efforts for decades, almost solving the Schism with the Orthodox Church and then gathering the Western Kings for the current Crusade. Such a brilliant diplomat with a strong sense of duty doesn't come into your web often, and you are considering your next moves carefully."
 podgreatpersons.0114.t: "Vidyapati"
 podgreatpersons.0114.desc: "Mortal customs change often, and too quickly for your tastes most of the time. Even a basic concept such as language isn't exempt. The prakrit-derived late Abahattha has just begun to transition into early versions of the Eastern languages such as Maithili and Bhojpuri.\nYou will need a mortal expert to decipher these changes for you. Your agents say that there will be no one better than Vidyapati, a popular poet of the royal courts of Bengal who has recently retired to his home town. He is also known as a able diplomat and a zealous Hindu, meaning he could be useful as a [ghoul|E] or a childe, and not only a translator."

 podgreatpersons.0115.desc: "An interesting mortal has come to your attention recently. Atukuri Molla is a popular poet, and as her popularity spread, she was invited to Sessions court and got an opportunity to recite Ramayana in front of Krishnadevaraya and his poets.\nMolla claims Sri Shiva as Guru, and her inspiration is said to have come from Pothanna, who wrote Bhagavata purana in Telugu. Like him, she is Saiva Hindu, but writes the story of Rama (an incarnation of Vishnu) and also refuses to dedicate her Ramayana to any king, a general practice for poets nowadays.\nFamous poets are always a lively, and prestigious, distraction to have at court, which means that you are considering bringing her closer to the night world."
 Boleslaus: "Boleslaus"

 podgreatpersons.0116.desc: "Mortal conflicts are always a time of opportunity for your kind. The recent Mongol invasion of Central Europe is no exception. The Christians lost the battle of Legnica and your agents have lurked in the shadows, and bring you news of the whereabouts of one Boleslaus, self proclaimed 'duke of Bohemia'.\nThis ambitious man has spent his whole life fighting for a long lost claim of his family, before joining his erstwhile foes into defending the realm. Despite the loss, he illustrated himself by his bravery and skills at both a commander and a warrior.

 podgreatpersons.0117.desc: "The mortal Seventh Crusade is coming to a close after the defeat of the Crusaders in the battle of Mansurah. Despite their earlier victories, the Christians charged too soon into the city, and only three knights of the original 280 came back to their home camp.\nOne of them is Guillaume de Sonnac, the Grandmaster of the Templar order, who fought his way out of the city but lost an eye in the process. He is now desperately leading a lost defense against the Muslim counterattack. Known as an able diplomat and skilled general, de Sonnac could be an interesting recruit for your court.

Of particular interest to you is the firing of Madan Rai, the last chief minister of the late king, who has always appeared to be a competent and diligent man.\nHe is renowned for luring the main general of the rival Brahmachal realm to his side, launching a series of events that culminated in the victory of the Gour Kingdom without even having to start a war.

Qutui Khatun, the mother of one of the recently assassinated Khan, has been a major political force despite the loss of her husband and now her son. The best proof being that the new Khan is currently marching on her city to stop her, as she is trying to secure support for herself.\nAs she is also known as a skilled administrator and diplomat, she has enough qualities to warrant your attention.

He did both quite admirably, defeating the Bainuk king Kikikor and annexing his state before founding many new Mandinka towns.\nHis mission accomplished, Traore is now resting in Mampating without his army, a rare position of vulnerability that you could exploit.

She greatly enjoyed this life of institutionalized piracy, and even boarded the Marie of San Sebastian when she heard rumors of its treasures.\nThis direct attack was a step too far, and she was caught while fencing stolen goods from her theft.

The number of campaigns he seems to have participated in is impressive, and the man certainly knows how to run his company.\nYou can understand such a soul, driven by both a lust for glory and gold.

Even for a creature of your age and experience, this mortal saw things that you probably can't even begin to imagine.

This has finally caught up with him, and Suleiman seems very close on ordering his execution. Ibrahim is oblivious to the threat but you aren't.

He then liberated Plevna, Rahovo, Vratsa, Vidin, and Florentin.\nNumerous smaller victories are also credited to him, making him a very skilled military commander.

Having a deep hatred of the Iberians since his forced exile from his home, Sinan fought in several key battles against the Spanish and the Holy Roman Empire.\nRenowned for his good tactical sense and being one of Barbarossa's favorites, this man has many qualities that could be of use to you.

Even the name of this linguist is mysterious, as he adopted his current one after being found by the famed explorer Vasco de Gama. What is known though is that he is fluent in many languages, and familiar with the geopolitics and customs of India.\nThese assets, and his natural charisma, have made him very valued by the Portuguese, who always rely on him when trading with (or conquering) new lands.

Constantine recently schemed his way into making sure that his son will inherit the Armenian throne. To do that, he first killed (after torturing and poisoing him) the current king, misled the loyal nobles to a wrong rescue mission then took the castle where the queen stayed and forced her to marry him.\nSuch ruthless ambitious is worthy of many $pod_cainites$' plots and certainly warrants your attention. Perhaps Constantine is ready to bring his talents for the lords of the night? You could fake his death and bring him to your court, where he could become a useful agent, or even a potential childe."

Studying among the humanist thoughts of Paris' university, Bodin is a convincing advocate for religious tolerance... but also for political absolutism. His theories proving very popular among the upper classes made him a favorite political advisor of several nobles, a period in which he proved able of carefully maneuvering the intrigue filled world of the nobility.\nThe concept of political absolutism certainly resonates to you and you are contemplating the idea of bringing the man closer to learn more."

When the throne was finally inherited by a young boy, Reynold was the stalwart center of the court, making sure that his King would suffer no harm.\nSuch a constant display of loyalty, skill at arms and shrewd political sense is intriguing and, since Reynold has recently been promoted to another position far from the court, you could be interested in arranging an 'accident' to make him disappear from mortal history."

A dutiful and skilled commander, Glabas has been a successful general for almost 40 years. Even the occasional setback or defeat only strengthened his skills, and few can boast to have truly won a war against him.\nNow an elderly man, Glabas has been writing a war manual to pass on his valuable experience.

While the new sultan Murat I was occupied in capturing Biga in Anatolia, a Crusader army appeared near the river Maritsa in Rumeli. Haci Ilbey was sent with a relatively small expedition force over to Crusaders.

Subsequently, he led a series of expeditions in the southern part of India, against the Yadavas (1308), the Kakatiyas (1310), the Hoysalas (1311), and the Pandyas (1311). From these campaigns, he brought back many treasures, and many elephants and horses for the Delhi Sultanate.\nAfter the sultan fell seriously ill, he was recalled to Delhi, where he now exercises power as Na'ib (viceroy). Malik is clearly trying to usurp power, using the minor son of the Sultan as a puppet.\nYour contacts in the court warn you that Malik is out of his league though, and a coalition is forming against him to oust him from power.

Amina herself is outside your reach as she is far too popular of a ruler already and any interference could lead back to you.

This challenge to the power of the Turkish nobility of Delhi is coming to a boiling point as they have started an open rebellion.\nJamal and Razia's cause seems hopeless as they are vastly outnumbered by the better trained Turkish troops and their recent defeat outside of Delhi has only hastened the inevitable.

Associated with Alauddin since the latter's days as a governor of Kara, Zafar Khan led a major division of Alauddin's army from Kara to Delhi after Alauddin assassinated his predecessor Jalaluddin in 1296. He then led the army that invaded Multan to eliminate the surviving members of Jalaluddin's family.\nZafar Khan also led the Delhi army that inflicted a crushing defeat on the Chagatai Mongol invaders at Jaran Manjur in 1298. Later that year, Alauddin dispatched Zafar Khan to recapture Sivistan from the Mongols.

To that end, she raised an army to fight off his brother Arhuaran, who was subsequently defeated in battle. Esigie thus became the 17th Oba of Benin.\nSubsequently, the neighboring Igala people sent warriors across the Benue River to wrest control of Benin's northern territories. Esigie conquered the Igala, reestablishing the unity and military strength of the kingdom.

 podgreatpersons.0203.desc: "An Italian who settled in Persia while it was part of the Mongol Ilkhanate, Buscarello started his career as an officer of the guard of the Mongol ruler Arghun.\nIn 1289, Arghun sent a mission to Europe, with Buscarello as ambassador, thus starting his official career as a go between Europe and the Mongols from 1289 to 1305, serving the Mongol rulers Arghun, Ghazan and then Oljeitu.\nWhile the alliances he tried to foster between East and West never materialized, Buscarello still became a most trusted agent of great rulers from England to Mongolia.\nNow back in the steppes, Buscarello has been targeted by [ashirra|E] agents wanting revenge for his part in the perceived joint attack by the Franks and the Mongols against the Mamluks. You have the opportunity to "save" him, perhaps using his considerable skills for your own diplomatic prospects in the future."
 Maria_Perez: "Maria Perez"               
 podgreatpersons.0204.t: "Maria Perez"
 podgreatpersons.0204.desc: "You have been hearing about a strange traveling artist named Maria Perez for a while now. This (apparently in self exile) noblewoman has been ascribed with many feats, from writing gaudy poetry to participating in a crusade or being a spy for several kings. She sometimes appears at a court, singing and entertaining nobles, shaming a few with them with her apparently considerable skills in archery, then disappearing away to the consternation of her many suitors.\nThe strange thing being that this has been going on for decades now, much longer than any mortal woman should be able to continue such an act. Your agents weren't capable of finding an answer to that mystery so you are still unsure if "Maria Perez" is really just one person or if several adventurous women use this name to earn some fame.\nIn any case, you were able to learn that she (or one of them at least) is passing through your local area. Your court is urging you to consider bringing her to the fold, probably eager to meet the legend in person."
 Hammu_ibn_Abd_al_Haqq: "Hammu ibn Abd al-Haqq"                   
 podgreatpersons.0205.t: "Hammu ibn Abd al-Haqq"
 podgreatpersons.0205.desc: "A Moroccan prince, Hammu ibn Abd al-Haqq unsuccessfully rebelled against the Marinid Sultan. Like many dissident princes, he was exiled to Granada to join the "Volunteers of the Faith", a military corps made up of North Africans who fought to defend Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula.\nThere, he commanded the troops that captured Bedmar from Castile in April 1302, two weeks after the Sultan's accession. This success didn't last however as Granada was soon engulfed in several crisis where Hammu picked the wrong side. Defeated by his fellow exiled prince Uthman, Hammu was soon forced to once again leave with nothing more than the clothes on his back.\nThis is a man that has shown military experience and navigated courtly politics. As he is now basically alone and defenseless, that makes him a tempting target for abduction and perhaps giving him a second chance under your guidance."
 Tegueste: "Tegueste"          
 podgreatpersons.0206.t: "Tegueste"
 podgreatpersons.0206.desc: "The Spanish mortals have recently found a new set of islands that they call "Canary". As mortals are prone to do, they have been trying to conquer it ever since.\nThe divided indigenous tribes of the islands have rallied behind a man named Tegueste.\nThe Spanish were hoping for an easy victory but were repelled decisively several times. Only the spread of an epidemic severely weakening the Guanche let the Spanish mount another attack... that also proved unsuccessful.\nThey then resorted to a divide and conquer tactic, managing to isolate Tegueste's tribe by dealing with the other minor kings first. Heavily outnumbered, Tegueste was forced to surrender and has since been made a slave to be paraded by the victorious Christians.\nThis man has shown a serious strength of character and considerable skills in warfare. You could arrange for his "disappearance" so that he is then brought to your court. He could certainly be more useful here than as a trophy for the Spanish."
 podgreatpersons.0207.t: "Doramas"
 podgreatpersons.0207.desc: "The Spanish mortals have recently found a new set of islands that they call "Canary". As mortals are prone to do, they have been trying to conquer it ever since.\nThe locals have rallied behind a young warrior named Doramas. Known for his dexterity in combat and his capacity for leadership, he carries a large wooden sword and is described as having a shield made from drago wood.\nHe reaped great success as the head of the Canary army, and it turned him into a charismatic leader in the aborigine resistance. Because of the great fame that Doramas won in the war, the Castilian captain began a decisive campaign against him personally, attacking him on his home turf. On August 20, 1481, while engaged in a bruising battle in the region of Arucas, Doramas fell victim to a lance-wound and died.\nThere might be more to this story however as a young man claiming to be this famous Guanche hero has suddenly appeared in your court. He says that the Spanish used another corpse to stage his death and break the Guanche's spirit. The rest of his story can wait but you now have a choice to make as it appears that he seeks an immortal patron, perhaps to truly avenge his people.\nWill you be this patron?"
 Yalbugha_al_Umari: "Yalbugha al-Umari"          
 podgreatpersons.0208.t: "Yalbugha al-Umari"
 podgreatpersons.0208.desc: "The Mamluk Sultanate that rules over Egypt is notoriously unstable with the caste of slave soldiers (the aforementioned mamluks) often clashing for power with the Sultans. One such example is Yalbugha al-Umari. Originally a mamluk of Sultan an-Nasir Hasan, he rose through the ranks as the senior emirs Shaykhu and Sirghitmish were eliminated, becoming the amir majlis (lord of the audience), and achieving the highest military rank of amir mi'a muqaddam alf. Ties between Yalbugha and an-Nasir Hasan deteriorated and the former had the latter, his master, killed in a violent power struggle in 1361.\nAfter an-Nasir Hasan's elimination, Yalbugha became the most powerful figure in the sultanate of al-Mansur Muhammad, who Yalbugha had a hand in appointing and under whom he served. His power was tempered by the other senior emirs.\nDuring these years, Yalbugha built up an enormous mamluk household of his own, consisting of some 3,000 mamluks in 1366. That same year, Yalbugha had Taybugha arrested and consolidated his rule.\nYalbugha's time is coming to an end however as a mamluk rebellion has erupted and will likely cause the ironic downfall of the once mamluk puppeteer. This gives you an opportunity to strike while he is weakened if you so wish."
 Bayram_Pasha: "Bayram Pasha"           
 podgreatpersons.0209.t: "Bayram Pasha"
 podgreatpersons.0209.desc: "The Ottoman Empire has been ruling over vast swathes of land for a while now and its peculiar administration has led to the emergence of many skilled bureaucrats. Bayram Pasha is one such man.\nOriginally a member of the famed the Janissary corps, Bayram rose through all the ranks, turnacıbasi (chief of recruiting teams), kethuda (chamberlain), beylerbey of Egypt (governor-general) and finally grand vizier, the highest office in the empire next to that of the sultan.\nBayram Pasha is reputed both in Egypt and in Anatolia for his efforts in construction of public works. He repaired the city walls of Constantinople and commissioned a mosque and a kulliye (religious complex) in the city. He also commissioned an irrigation facility and a caravansarai in Amasya. Bayram Pasha is also known as the patron of various inns in Anatolian towns.\nBayram's life is coming to an end however as his health is rapidly failing him. Now far from the halls of power, that could be the opportunity for you to recruit a talented administrator for your own, nightly, empire."
