 #POD_web_of_knives.1.t: "Trial of Skill"
 #POD_web_of_knives.1.desc: "You have been contacted by one of the Web of Knives elusive recruiter. There will be three trials under his supervision and the first one will be a 'simple' test of skill against him. Using sword or intrigue, you will have to impress him enough for the process to continue. You have the choice between these two types of assassin skills to demonstrate."
 #POD_web_of_knives.1.a: "The sword"
 #POD_web_of_knives.1.effect.success.desc: "You triumphed!"
 #POD_web_of_knives.1.critical.failure.effect.desc: "You were defeated..."
 #POD_web_of_knives.1.b: "Scheming is my forte"
 #POD_web_of_knives.1.c: "I'm not ready yet"
 #web_setback_tooltip: "You give up on the trial for now. You will be able to come back to it."
 #POD_web_of_knives.1.d: "That's way too hard!"
 #web_ending_tooltip: "You give up on the trial and cut all ties you had to the Web. You won't be able to contact them in the future."
 # 
 #POD_web_of_knives.3.t: "Trial: Defeated"
 #POD_web_of_knives.3.desc: "You have been deemed unworthy during the trial. The Web of Knives won't work with you for now and you will have to wait some time before trying again, if that is something you even want to consider. Nothing of real value has been lost though, except a bit of pride."
 #POD_web_of_knives.3.a: "Next time, I will be ready"
 #web_trial_failure_tooltip: "You will be able to try again in 5 years" 
 #POD_web_of_knives.3.b: "These lunatics aren't worth my time!"
 #
 #POD_web_of_knives.2.t: "Trial of Humanity"
 #POD_web_of_knives.2.desc: "The second trial is actually quite simple. You must kill the specific mortal presented in front of you. No questions answered, no reasons given.\nJust senseless murder.\nClearly, they are testing if you are capable of following orders, no matter how brutal or idiotic they might seem. They also are probably judging your moral limits, as the members of the Web are known as very inhumane vampires."
 #POD_web_of_knives.2.a: "Senseless murder it is"
 #POD_web_of_knives.2.b: "This is going too far... for now"
 #POD_web_of_knives.2.c: "This is going too far!"
 #
 #POD_web_of_knives.5.t: "Trial of Faith"
 #POD_web_of_knives.5.desc: "The last trial is actually more of a pledge than anything else. The Web of Knives believes in a fanciful tale where Haqim embraced himself to fight against the 'Damned Children of Khayyin'. Their whole assassin business is merely a front to kill as much $pod_masquerade_exposure_with_icon$ as possible in impunity and slowly take over their whole [Clan|E].\nClearly, they are demented and delusional... or are they? Perhaps there is something about a bloody unrepentant murderer cult that appeals to you. Or you could just pretend to believe in their fanciful tales... but they would clearly take grave offense if they ever find out."
 #POD_web_of_knives.5.a: "Glory to Haqim!"
 #POD_web_of_knives.5.b: "Glory to Haqim..."
 #POD_web_of_knives.5.effect.success.desc: "They believe you!"
 #POD_web_of_knives.5.success: "You are in!"
 #POD_web_of_knives.5.critical.failure.effect.desc: "They don't believe you..." 
 #POD_web_of_knives.5.critical.failure: "Don't trust cults"    
 #POD_web_of_knives.5.c: "I must politely decline"
 #join_web_tooltip: "You will join the Web, getting access to a new panel with contracts to be fulfilled"
 #
 #web_of_knives_intro: "You can kill the targets by any means."
 #web_of_knives_intro2: "You get a Pursue Contract [interaction|E] ending in a lethal duel with them."
 #
 #POD_web_of_knives.6.t: "Assassin!"
 #POD_web_of_knives.6.desc: "You have been studying your target for a while now, learning their habits, their strengths and more importantly their weaknesses. Vampires are paranoid creatures by nature, and it is often quite hard finding a moment in time where the deed can be done, but your thorough recon managed to find such an opportunity.\nJumping from the shadows, you strike first. Only one of you will walk out of this encounter alive."
 #POD_web_of_knives.6.a: "Death comes for you!"
 web_of_knives_diablerie_tt: "A duel to the death. You will be offered to perform a [diablerie|E] if you win."
 #POD_web_of_knives.6.b: "Your soul is mine!"

 POD_web_of_knives.7.t: "The Web of Knives"
 POD_web_of_knives.7.desc: "The Children of Haqim have a long, if hotly debated internally, tradition of acting as mercenaries or killers for hire for other vampires. Organized under the secretive Web of Knives faction, these contracts bring great wealth (and opportunities for [diablerie|E] for the less scrupulous) to the adventurous Banu Haqim. While no member of the clan is forced into following this practice, most of them at least dabble in it, at the very least to reinforce the other vampires' misconceptions of the Banu Haqim all being bloodthirsty killers not to be messed with.\n #X The Web of Knives is a defining feature of the Banu Haqim. You will periodically receive offers to pursue a contract. If you accept, a victory will bring you gold, prestige and an opportunity for [diablerie|E].#!"
 POD_web_of_knives.7.a: "An useful reputation to maintain."

 POD_web_of_knives.600.t: "Their Head and their Soul"
 POD_web_of_knives.600.desc: "Your direct assault against your victim paid off. They stand cowed before you, unable to muster any resistance to your next actions. A simple, clean, death would fulfill the contract and gives you the promised rewards but you also know that the Web of Knives encourages [diablerie|E] as part of the victor's spoils.\nThe allure is certainly there, with your defeated foe's blood calling to you, begging to be put to a more useful purpose..."
 POD_web_of_knives.600.option.a: "Your head and your soul."
 POD_web_of_knives.600.option.b: "Your head will suffice."
 
 POD_web_of_knives.10.t: "The Price on their Head"
 POD_web_of_knives.10.desc: "You have contacted the shadowy organization known as the Web of Knives intend on putting a target on your rival's head. Their conditions are as such: you pay half the gold right now and half on fulfillment of the contract. The more you pay, the more skilled of a Web member they will send. No refund of your first half if the hit fails.\nThere is also this strange demand of you giving a small drop of your blood to apparently be shipped to the grandmaster of their order but they reassure you that it's only a tradition and nothing more sinister. If you can't trust hired killers, who can you trust really?"
 POD_web_of_knives.10.a: "A small sum should suffice."
 wok_reward_low_tt: "If your target has more than 10 intrigue or 20 prowess, this option has no chance of success.\nYou will get a result in a couple of months.\nBetter options are available only in areas with a strong Web of Knives presence."
 POD_web_of_knives.10.b: "I can offer more."
 wok_reward_medium_tt: "If your target has more than 15 intrigue or 30 prowess, this option has no chance of success.\nYou will get a result in a couple of months.\nBetter options are available only in areas with a strong Web of Knives presence."
 POD_web_of_knives.10.c: "I am a vampire of means."
 wok_reward_high_tt: "If your target has more than 20 intrigue or 40 prowess, this option has no chance of success.\nYou will get a result in a couple of months.\nOnly available where the Web of Knives presence is historically strong."
 POD_web_of_knives.10.d: "I want them dead!"
 wok_reward_very_high_tt: "If your target has more than 25 intrigue or 50 prowess, this option has no chance of success.\nYou will get a result in a couple of months.\nOnly available where the Web of Knives presence is historically at its strongest."
 POD_web_of_knives.10.e: "On second thought..."     
 
 POD_web_of_knives.11.desc: "It has been a few months since you contacted the Web of Knives for their help in fixing your little problem. You have been keeping tabs on your rival and have recently learned of an assassination attempt targeting them. While their court is abuzz, you are thankful for the professionalism of the Web that makes sure that, whatever the result is, the event can't be traced back to you.\nNow, you only need to check if they were successful or not..."
 POD_web_of_knives.11.a: "They did it! Now to pay the other half..."
 POD_web_of_knives.11.b: "They failed! Useless thugs..."
 
 POD_web_of_knives.13.desc: "Your contact in the Web of Knives has recently informed you of a contract being put on the head of a vampire in your area. The Web has several agents that could try to fulfill this mission but you get the first pick if you wish to pursue it yourself.\nAs always, two options lie before you. A subtle murder could work and leave you far from the (probably very angry) potential victim if things were to go south, or you could go for a more "hands on" approach. This is obviously way riskier but also the only way to ensure the potential for a [diablerie|E] in the end..."
 POD_web_of_knives.13.a: "No need for unnecessary risks."
 wok_intrigue_duel_tt: "This option doesn't risk you more than a prestige loss if you fail. You won't get a chance to diablerize your victim if you win however."
 POD_web_of_knives.13.effect.success.desc: "Silent and deadly"
 POD_web_of_knives.13.critical.failure.effect.desc: "A failure..."
 POD_web_of_knives.13.b: "A direct assault!"
 POD_web_of_knives.13.c: "I won't take this contract."
