 pod1230objectives.1.t: "Setting the Sun"
 pod1230objectives.1.desc: "Most of you have long heard the false tale of the Persian 'God', Mithras, of his unending exploits and ambitions for the isles. Tonight, you will hear the whole, sad truth. Mithras wanted us to think he came to the British Isles as a savior, but the truth is, he was fleeing from his failures in Ancient Rome, seeing our homeland as a backwater barely fit enough to rebuild his power base. Now, he has failed once more, as Britannia is under a new, united leadership. His cult scatters, driven out by fire and sword and destined to become a mere footnote of the isles' history. As I proclaim to you the fall of the 'Unconquered Sun', I also proclaim that Britannia is finally ready to become its own driving force in [cainite|E] society."

 pod1230objectives.3.desc: "The line between an ancient Vampire and a God is thin. But in Mithras' case, it's even blurrier. The sheer charisma and power of the entity known as a God to ancient Persians and Romans is still staggering and, even though mortals have moved on, a shift of paradigm has recently occurred. With the lack of any credible rivals to the mantle of Ventrue leadership, the cult of Mithras has managed to gather sufficient influence to, in a way, become [Clan|E] Ventrue itself. No longer confined to Britannia, the faithful of the Unconquered Sun are more powerful than ever and their undeniable faith is shaking Vampire's tenets to the core. The Biblical origin story is starting to fade from younger vampires memories, replaced by inspiring tales of undying champions faithful to the Warrior Sun-God. Kindred society will never be the same."

 pod1230objectives.6.desc: "They come bearing gifts. Powerful [cainites|E] from across Europe, eager to see the new ruler of Constantinople. As they enter your richly decorated throne room, you ask yourself how many will have propositions, threats or daggers waiting for you before the end of the night. You also idly wonder, was this Michael's plan all along? Did he know that his Dream required a change of leadership, a fresh vision? You will probably never know. What you do know is that your illustrious guests all want to learn something tonight and their gifts are a part of this scheme. Michael, self proclaimed Archangel, would have refused such worldly offerings or even be offended by them. If you refuse as well, you will truly be seen as Michael’s Heir. But perhaps the Dream needs to take a new path under your leadership, and you can make the first move right now. Will you…?"

 pod1230objectives.8.desc: "The bloody civil war of the Spanish Lasombra is over. You now stand as the lone victor, a lord of ruins. It was a hard fought battle, but merely a stepping stone on your path to greater power. Decisive victory has provided you a great deal of magnanimity, and opened many doors. As a matter of fact, the coveted position of master of the Sea of Shadows, and thus all of [Clan|E] Lasombra, has been offered to you. It is obviously a trap, and they all expect you to fail miserably. For your reign to end as quickly as it began so they may return to their petty squabbles without you standing in their way. But this won't happen. You intend to make them regret their futile scheming. You have tamed Iberia after all, bending the Mediterranean and a few decrepit elders to your will can't be any more difficult... Right?"

 pod1230objectives.10.desc: "For centuries now, the Children of Canarl have slowly been dying off. The constant assault by servants of the Cross, both mortal and undead, had converted their once pious flock to a small, weak people. But no more. As the invasion of the German Ventrue collapses, and proud [einherjar|E] once again instill terror in the hearts of the Children of Caine, the faith is reborn anew. Under a new leader, with new doctrines and leadership, the [einherjar|E] are now something greater than even Odin could have imagined, the Wanderer chooses them well, and they are now his family, the Aesir of tomorrow. They are boldly stepping into this age as the Viking Gods they truly are. As they huddle, terrified in their broody castles, the weak Southern Vampires have nothing to hope but a merciful death when their very own Ragnarok comes. And come it will."

 pod1230objectives.12.desc: "The Lasombra civil war in Iberia was a bloody affair, born of the mortal Spanish Reconquista and the growing unrest between Christian and [ashirra|E] [cainites|E]. It was a sordid period for the Faithful at the start, with betrayals, fallen cities and darker secrets conspiring to bring down the Midnight Crescent. As such, your victory was most unexpected. As the mortal Iberian Taifas fall one after another, the [ashirra|E] faithful still managed to overcome their northern Christian neighbors. It is a strange turn of events indeed. As the Sea of Shadows crumbles because of their misguided alliance with the Christians, you now rule over a new, barely recognizable land and people. In a way, your victory saved the last relic of the Muslim golden age in Iberia. You are as much victors as you are caretakers of a rich history. A daunting prospect, but one to which you are proud to attend."

For so long, you've had this feeling that you were destined to be here with your brothers and sisters of [Clan|E] Malkavian beside you. This wasn’t easy, you had to ask nicely, and sometimes not so nicely, the princes along the way. You even had to kick some of them out of their comfy thrones. You hear of courts whispering that you are on the way to creating an unified [Clan|E] Malkavian. It’s funny because you never meant to, but you kind of did anyway. What's important is you're here now, and the voices grow louder, telling you to do... stuff! The time of enlightenment is here! Or was it salvation? You are not really sure.

But the light of Rome can never truly be extinguished, and will still guide us forward as the sun shuns us evermore. Be proud of our heritage but mindful of our foes. We must never falter into complacency or decadence again for we have seen what dark times await our kind without our guiding hand.

An entire [Clan|E] looks upon you in wonder, will you claim the mantle of Troile and bring upon a new Golden Age for Vampires? This choice will make you many new enemies, and you know that even Troile had failed to safeguard Carthage against infernal influence. Or will you claim Carthage as a political tool, refusing its mixed legacy? This move will earn you the respect of many other clans, but you will then be no better than the Ventrue.

Since the dawn of Time, your brothers and sisters have chosen to flee, to hide in the shadows and pray for their unlives. You are tired of that. If the Founder wants a war, he will have it on your terms. Your [Clan|E] was wary of your initiative at first, calling it reckless, but now they see the truth.

The sun bestowed a single ray of divine light on Svarog, god of smithing and celestial fire. Svarog then created Dazbog: warrior-god of the sun, and enemy of all that is unholy.\nDazbog tracked the serpent to the land of the Slavs, and their battle was terrible to behold. He bound the serpent to the land but Dazbog knew that the hordes of darkness were too numerous for him alone and he despaired. A mortal warrior approached the god as he sat weeping, and she chided Dazbog when he explained the cause of his despair. The purpose of battle wasn’t always to win, she told him, but rather to keep fighting. Dazbog’s savior and compatriot died aeons ago, but warriors still flock to their banner.\nThe warriors have an ancient feud with the servants of Kupala, including Clan Tzimisce. Terrible foes as they are, most warriors die way before having claimed even their first vampiric kill.
