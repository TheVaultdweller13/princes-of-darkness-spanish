 POD_vampire_banes.0001.t: "Entranced by Beauty"
 POD_vampire_banes.0001.desc.intro: "The Toreador have a keen eye for beauty. So keen that they can be driven to ecstatic heights, enraptured, enthralled by a true glimpse of it.\n\n"
 POD_vampire_banes.0001.desc.painting: "You saw the painting in passing, then went back to look at it again, and again, staring at it for hours at a time. The radiant colors, the subtle shading and brushwork, the layering of the artist's intent over an otherwise ordinary scene... every night you spend with this painting, you notice something new."
 POD_vampire_banes.0001.desc.song: "You heard it by chance. A scullery maid, singing aimlessly to herself while working. And yet, the melody she so artlessly composed had a depth to it, a spark of the divine. Night after night you hum it to yourself, trying to recapture the brilliance of that moment."
 POD_vampire_banes.0001.desc.sculpture: "You rarely notice the sculptures that adorn your halls and hallways. But one night one caught your eye. It was half-forgotten in its niche, rarely cleaned, and yet the traces of dust brought out the best of it, shading the curves and edges of this accidental masterpiece. Forbidding your servants to touch it, you come back to this sculpture night after night, finding new beauty in it every time."
 POD_vampire_banes.0001.desc.poem: "Sometimes the library can be dangerous. Especially when you pick up a book and half a poem falls out. Half a poem! And one with such potential. It speaks to something true in the soul, but the missing parts are maddening. Night after night you try out rhymes to complete the poem. You get closer every time, but none of your work does it justice."
 POD_vampire_banes.0001.desc.end: "\n\nA distraction like this can last for months before it fades away."
 POD_vampire_banes.0001.a: "Beauty is the soul of the world."
