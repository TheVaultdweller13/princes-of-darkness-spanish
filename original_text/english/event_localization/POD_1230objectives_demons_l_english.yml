  pod1230objectives_demons.1.desc: "Faith is the way that demons power many of their abilities; as angels, they had endless amounts off faith to manipulate. Most fallen now "harvest" faith from willing humans by forming pacts.\nWith each Demon now being an embodiment of one of the core sins, the best way for them to gain more power is to corrupt more mortals. Small cults are easy enough to set up but you have achieved something much more impressive with the creation of a sizable web of theological influence in your area.\nWhile many are ignorant of the real situation, most inhabitants of this region are now fueling your rise to power each time they pray to the divine... or when they indulge in their desires.\nSuch a victory will ensure that you will never run out of faith, making the horrors of the Abyssal Prison a distant nightmare. Obviously, if you are looking towards revenge instead, it could also be a fitting start for your inevitable ascension as God's greatest enemy..."

  pod1230objectives_demons.2.t: "Abyssal Prison Break"
  pod1230objectives_demons.2.desc: "Lucifer's rebellion was ultimately lost by his followers and the defeated were thrown into an Abyssal prison of God's design to repent on their crimes for all eternity. Since then however, many Demons (such as yourself) have escaped from cracks on the prison, or by being summoned by overambitious Infernalists. Still, this is a mere trickle compared to the Host of Hell still imprisoned there.\nOpening wide such an impregnable fortress is not easy feat but your recent rise to power has given you new opportunities. You might not be the Almighty yet, but you are now strong enough to be a threat to the Abyss.\nEach time you open a new hole in the prison, more and more of your brethren escape to join you on Earth. Many of them have lost the divine nature they once had as Angels but what good could keeping them locked in Hell could really do at this point? Some of them might still find redemption and for the others, well, they now look at you at the new Lucifer that will guide them towards a retribution of Biblical proportions thousands of years in the making..."

  pod1230objectives_demons.3.desc: "God abandoned this world long ago, dejected at humanity's failures and his faithful angels' rebellion. You, and the other Fallen, were cast out from Heaven to rot in Hell forever. But you endured, better yet, you triumphed. Despite all the efforts of God's agents and the petty intrigues of other supernatural creatures, the world is now singing your unholy praises, casting you as a rival to the Almighty itself.\nIt is time for the ultimate affront, the Apocalypse predicted so long ago. Tear the stars from the sky, cast down all of Creation and throw the ashes into the face of God. Then, and only then, will you have enough power to lead your infernal Host for the final divine battle."

  pod1230objectives_demons.4.desc: "During the most violent times in the War of Heaven, Abaddon and Asmodeus (two of Lucifer's lieutenants) made abhorrent experimentations that resulted in the birth of the Nephilim: the offspring of a demon with a human host and a mortal woman. While some of them were benevolent, most were twisted and corrupted by their immortal "fathers" wanting to use their unlimited potential in their own rebellion against Lucifer.\nThose early Nephilim committed heinous crimes against humanity, until Lucifer and those still loyal to him managed to stop them.\nAs you have finally managed to uncover the secrets of their creation, you are able to bring forth a new breed of Nephilim. Will they be used for good or evil? The choice will be yours."

  pod1230objectives_demons.5.desc: "Your memories are finally back and you remember everything. The Creation, God's light upon the world, the first fumbling footsteps of humanity, Lucifer's pleas for protecting the mortals despite God's plans... it has all came back to you. And with it, a deep sense of loss. Loss of your original purpose, of God's loving gaze upon you, of the untamed potential you once fostered upon the mortals.\nSince then, you did horrible things and were punished for it. Then you escaped from the Abyssal Prison, perhaps as one of God's tests for you. Clearly, you haven't been much better since returning to Earth but, in the end, it doesn't matter. You see the truth now. No matter how wicked a being, no matter how heinous the crimes they commit, there is always a chance for forgiveness.\nYou only have to take the first step towards it, and the last step of your journey."

  pod1230objectives_demons.6.desc: "In ancient kingdoms such as Babylonia and Sumeria, each demon’s circle of worshipers grew into a cult, then a full-fledged religion, with temples and idols carved in the spirit’s likeness appearing in cities, villages and households across the land.\nAs the trickle of faith swelled to a steady stream, then a surging river, the Earthbound used their lore to sate their rage and punish the unbelievers with curses, plague and famine.\nIn no other time since Creation did the Fallen Angels ever ruled so openly over the weak humanity. The fall of these civilizations and the rise of monotheism weakened the demons considerably, forcing many to go into slumber or be banished back into the Abyss.\nClaiming the mantle of these inglorious times send a very strong message to your brothers and sisters in sin."

  pod1230objectives_demons.7.t: "Primordial Sin Dragon"
  pod1230objectives_demons.7.desc: "Some mortals, believing that they could achieve spiritual and moral purity by expunging themselves of sin, spent years searching for ways to live better in the eyes of God. When the years proved that human nature made it nigh impossible to avoid the seven deadly sins, the course of their path changed.\nMembers of more than one sect ended their lives in sacrifice, certain that the sins of the flesh could be absolved once the body was left behind. Others fell to darker paths, believing it was not their own failure, but that of mankind. They destroyed entire villages in the name of expunging sin, never once seeing the irony of their own acts.\nUltimately the movement dwindled and became a distant memory to all but the peoples of villages nestled on the edges of the Black Forest. The priest of the village, a borderline heretic, had a vision of a great magical rite capable of ripping the very sins from human flesh and banishing them from the world.\nFor forty days and forty nights, in accord with God's punishment for sins, the flock fasted. On the forty-first day, amid the prayer and song of service, an angel entered the church doors. "You have done well," he said. "Your sins are absolved and will be nevermore.” Blue-white light filled the church, drowning out even the sun. When the light faded, seven vicious beasts stood before the congregation howling for blood. They found it.\nOnce the last of the congregation fell to the beasts, silence reigned. Each creature looked to the others with innate knowledge of their place in the world. A primordial beacon of one of the deadly sins."

  pod1230objectives_demons.8.desc: "After many eons trapped in the Abyss thinking about your fate, and now seeing what the world has become after you and your fellow fallen escaped, you were left with so many questions and uncertainties. What was God's plan? What was your part in it? Why did you have to suffer for so long in this hellish prison?\nYou wanted to know the answers to many of these questions... and now you know everything, You know the true goals of your Creator, every mystery in the world, every query asked by a sentient mind be they truly mundane or unfathomable for mortals.\nYou KNOW the motivations behind God's actions, and you think you should be able to visit Him for a talk (or an argument) that will shake the very core of Creation."

  pod1230objectives_demons.9.desc: "God has abandoned this world long ago, you know that for a fact after seeing the state of this wretched place. With that knowledge you gather the worship of as many mortals as possible because you know that God created mankind with a spark of His divinity in them and you have plans to use this for your own ascension. Humanity clearly squandered their potential despite Lucifer's rebellion and, in a way, you are salvaging what little use they can still be for a greater purpose.\nPerhaps you will even let them enjoy it in the end.\nNow with the faith of so many souls at your disposal, your final push towards divinity is at end. You won't challenge God himself, not yet at least, but for all intents and purposes, you will become His equal.\nPerhaps, in time, His better."
