 podregionalpersons.2.t:0 "The Hunter Hunted"
 podregionalpersons.2.desc:0 "For some time now, your entourage is abuzz with rumors of a mortal hunting [cainites|E] around your area. Obviously, mortals have little luck in this endeavor most of the time, especially when they go the lone wolf road, as this individual seems to do.\nWhat is interesting is that, despite all these flaws, this hunter has shown some early success, and many dark alleys are safer because of him. He is elusive though, and you are really unsure of where he will strike next, or even if he will at all. But you could keep agents close to the ground in an attempt to track him down if you wanted."
 podregionalpersons.2.a:0 "I want to know everything about him"
 podregionalpersons.2.custom:0 "Be warned, there could be serious consequences..."
 podregionalpersons.2.b:0 "It is of no concern to me"
 podregionalpersons.2.customb:0 "You won't hear of him again"
 podregionalpersons.2.c:0 "I want to know everything about him"
 podregionalpersons.2.customc:0 "Perhaps you could recruit this talented individual?"
 podregionalpersons.4.t:0 "The Hunter Hunted II"
 podregionalpersons.4.desc:0 "You found him. This elusive hunter is one Karl Schrekt from Vienna. A man of few words, he was difficult to track down, and even more difficult to assess.\nThe zeal of God's fury burns inside him, that is plain to see, but it is tainted by a bitterness that makes him unaware of the suffering he causes during his hunts. You fear that his soul is on the brink, and God's army will lose an impressive man if his faith falters even more.\nPerhaps you can remind him of the glory of God and shows him the virtues of working in a coherent group? It will be a hard debate though, as the man is nothing if not stubborn..."
 podregionalpersons.4.a:0 "Brother, heed God's Words"
 podregionalpersons.4.effect.success.desc:0 "You manage to convince Karl to join your cause without issues"
 podregionalpersons.4.success:0 "Karl joins you!"
 podregionalpersons.4.failure.effect.desc:0 "Your faith is tested, but you manage to convince him in the end"
 podregionalpersons.4.failure:0 "Karl joins you!"
 podregionalpersons.4.critical.failure.effect.desc:0 "He is lost to the light..."
 podregionalpersons.4.critical.failure:0 "Karl is gone"
 podregionalpersons.4.c:0 "He is too far gone already"
 podregionalpersons.3.t:0 "The Hunter Hunted II"
 podregionalpersons.3.desc:0 "The lone hunter causing a mess around your area is still eluding you, but you have managed to have, at least, a general idea on his modus operandi. With this understanding, you have devised two plans of action to misled and, hopefully, capture this individual.\nBoth plans will require you to pull some strings and are likely to attract unwanted attention on your operations. You can't back down now though, as it seems that the hunter himself is closing in on your position as well... A confrontation is inevitable at this point."
 podregionalpersons.3.a:0 "Let us set a trap for him"
 podregionalpersons.3.b:0 "A direct confrontation is more my style"
 podregionalpersons.5.t:0 "The Hunter Hunted III"
 podregionalpersons.5.desc:0 "You must confess that you are somewhat nervous. At this time, your agents must be waiting at the old manor you set up as a front to trap the elusive hunter. You know his name now, Karl Schrekt from Vienna, a lone wolf with a drive rarely seen even among his zealous kind. You are fairly confident that you planned your trap well, and your men are good enough to subdue him.\nBut... if he were to escape, or worse, kill your men, he would deal a very serious blow to your control over the area. And you would also have lost your only chance of capturing him."
 podregionalpersons.5.a:0 "No turning back now"
 podregionalpersons.5.effect.success.desc:0 "The plan goes smoothly"
 podregionalpersons.5.success:0 "We got him!"
 podregionalpersons.5.failure.effect.desc:0 "He did some damage, but you won"
 podregionalpersons.5.failure:0 "We got him!... barely"
 podregionalpersons.5.critical.failure.effect.desc:0 "Karl flees, after dispatching your agents"
 podregionalpersons.5.critical.failure:0 "He got us..."
 podregionalpersons.6.t:0 "The Hunter Hunted III"
 podregionalpersons.6.desc:0 "Average attendance at your court tonight when, suddenly, several torches come tumbling from nowhere in the middle of the room. You barely manage to contain your terrified Beast as the cries of horror and frenzying vampires are heard all around you.\nAs you attempt to flee the chaotic scene, a hooded figure blocks your way, seemingly unaware of the fire raging around you.\nNot saying a word, he starts closing in on you, a burning torch on each hand. The maddening zeal in his eyes leaves no doubt, it looks like the elusive lone wolf hunter found you before you found him..."
 podregionalpersons.6.a:0 "Stop him! NOW!"
 podregionalpersons.6.effect.success.desc:0 "You manage to overpower and capture him!"
 podregionalpersons.6.success:0 "We got him!"
 podregionalpersons.6.failure.effect.desc:0 "He did some damage, but you won"
 podregionalpersons.6.failure:0 "We got him!... barely"

 podregionalpersons.7.t:0 "Ulf's Hall"
 podregionalpersons.7.desc:0 "A report has come back to you that the legendary Ulf's Hall has been found.\nThis small island near Norway allegedly contains the treasure of the famed Valdaermen, the Norse Runemages. Their time is long gone, as the Christian God has swept away their faith in the continent. But it seems a small cabal of them still clings to the Hall, protecting what might be quite the treasure cache, given the power they had in centuries past...\nWhat will you do with this information?"
 podregionalpersons.7.a:0 "Time for a raid I say!"
 podregionalpersons.7.custom:0 "Be warned, there could be serious consequences..."
 podregionalpersons.7.b:0 "We must protect these servants of Odin!"
 podregionalpersons.7.c:0 "I have more pressing matters to attend to"
 podregionalpersons.7.customb:0 "You won't hear of this story again"
 podregionalpersons.8.t:0 "Ulf's Hall II"
 podregionalpersons.8.desc:0 "A small and unassuming fishing village, Ulf's Hall isn't the grandiose golden city you expected.\nStill, as you survey the surroundings, you know better than to underestimate the cabal of Runemages that likely dwell here. As you see it, you have two options : An all out assault right now where they don't expect it, or feign friendship with their cause to backstab them when an opportunity presents itself."
 podregionalpersons.8.a:0 "We will send these fools to their Valhalla!"
 podregionalpersons.8.effect.success.desc:0 "You overcome the village with ease"
 podregionalpersons.8.failure.effect.desc:0 "You took a serious hit, but the village is yours"
 podregionalpersons.8.critical.failure.effect.desc:0 "The Runemages strike your forces down"
 podregionalpersons.8.failure:0 "You took a hit"
 podregionalpersons.8.b:0 "Let's meet our new 'friends'..."
 podregionalpersons.8.effect.success.descb:0 "They welcome you heartily"
 podregionalpersons.8.critical.failure.effect.descb:0 "They are suspicious..."
 podregionalpersons.9.t:0 "Ulf's Hall III"
 podregionalpersons.9.desc:0 "The battle was hard fought, as you anticipated, the Runemages were taken by surprise, but not without defense. Most of your forces have been wounded, or outright killed, by traps, the smallfolk or the mages themselves.\nBut now, you are within the Hall itself, with only their leader standing before you. And, behind him, you can already see the glittering gold of the famed treasure...\nYou could make a run for it and grab as much gold as you can before fleeing. Or you could try to challenge this powerful Norse mage to a duel for the full reward."
 podregionalpersons.9.a:0 "I'm not afraid of this guy"
 podregionalpersons.9.effect.success.desc:0 "You cut this fool in half! The gold is yours!"
 podregionalpersons.9.success:0 "A total victory!"
 podregionalpersons.9.critical.failure.effect.desc:0 "You were not prepared..."
 podregionalpersons.9.critical.failure:0 "The End"
 podregionalpersons.9.b:0 "I'm not afraid of this guy... but I still prefer to run"
 podregionalpersons.10.t:0 "Ulf's Hall III"
 podregionalpersons.10.desc:0 "You were utterly crushed. The Runemages had traps, mystical warning systems and the smallfolk was fully behind them. Your army stood for just long enough to allow a small group of you to flee with the boat you used to come here.\nNow, you must prepare the future, as this setback will clearly weight on your prestige at home. You still have the control of the narrative though..."
 podregionalpersons.10.a:0 "It was a ruse to purge the traitors in my realm!"
 podregionalpersons.10.b:0 "They were hundreds! And Odin himself fought with them!"
 podregionalpersons.11.t:0 "Ulf's Hall III"
 podregionalpersons.11.desc:0 "You managed to make the Runemages think that you are on their side. As such, it was way too late when they finally understood your true nature. Your forces have slain most of the cabal and taken control of the village.\nBut now, you see the two surviving members of the Cabal springing into action. Their leader, a solid Norseman known as Brand, is trying to pin you down as the other member gather the treasure to run away.\nIf you lose time with Brand, you will lose some of the gold, but potentially gain an useful prisoner..."
 podregionalpersons.11.a:0 "This man is worth more than mere gold..."
 podregionalpersons.11.b:0 "Gold! More gold!"
 podregionalpersons.12.t:0 "Ulf's Hall III"
 podregionalpersons.12.desc:0 "They saw through your ruse quite easily. And they utterly crushed you as soon as they understood that you lied about your true intentions.\nYou men barely managed to hold down their ground to allow you to flee to the boat you used to come here. Obviously, this setback will be a major blow to your prestige back at home but... you can still control the narrative of the situation, somewhat."
 podregionalpersons.12.a:0 "It was a ruse to purge the traitors in my realm!"
 podregionalpersons.12.b:0 "They were hundreds! And Odin himself fought with them!"
 podregionalpersons.13.t:0 "Ulf's Hall II"
 podregionalpersons.13.desc:0 "The Runemages were hard to convince. They are a weary lot, hiding for so long, but your shared traditions helped find a common ground. You let them knew that their position is compromised and others will come with more hostile intentions than you.\nAs such, they are now preparing to leave, and offer you a small part of their treasure to reward you for your help. Though, if you are persuasive enough, you might convince them to join your realm and enjoy your protection, which would obviously yield more benefits."
 podregionalpersons.13.a:0 "Come with us! Ragnarok can still be avoided"
 podregionalpersons.13.effect.success.desc:0 "They are convinced!"
 podregionalpersons.13.critical.failure.effect.desc:0 "They aren't convinced..."
 podregionalpersons.13.b:0 "Thank you brothers, and sail well"
 podregionalpersons.13.critical.failure:0 "They aren't convinced..."
 podregionalpersons.14.t:0 "Ulf's Hall III"
 podregionalpersons.14.desc:0 "You were able to convince the Valdaermen to join your realm, and your protection. They are already starting to provide quite the help in your capital, using their mystical abilities to help the populace.\nAlthough... they also came here with their treasure, and you could backstab them, claim the treasure for yourself, then expel the Runemages. You sure Odin wouldn't mind."
 podregionalpersons.14.a:0 "Let us make our new friends feel at home"
 podregionalpersons.14.b:0 "...Gold is gold"
 podregionalpersons.15.t:0 "The Last Cathar"
 podregionalpersons.15.desc:0 "A strange individual has recently arrived in your court. This young boy is apparently a refugee of Montsegur, the last fortress of the Cathars, recently fallen to the Crusaders. You have heard many conflicting reports of this event, from the famed treasure of the Cathars being hidden away before the siege, to the 'Cathar Christ' cursing the Christians when brought to the pyre.\nYou can't deny this boy's piety, but leaving him preach in your court could be dangerous, as the Cathars have many more enemies than they have friends..."
 podregionalpersons.15.a:0 "Invite him to a theological debate"
 podregionalpersons.15.b:0 "Let him talk, but survey him closely"
 podregionalpersons.15.c:0 "Kick him out, he will only bring trouble"
 podregionalpersons.16.t:0 "The Last Cathar II"
 podregionalpersons.16.desc:0 "The debate has been interesting, and you had many more since them. Perhaps the 'Pure Ones' had a point? The young boy speaks of a way for you to follow the true faith, even in your damned state.\nIt is tempting, but politics wise, your conversion to a very mistrusted faith could have serious consequences..."
 podregionalpersons.16.a:0 "My soul's salvation is worth more than petty politics"
 podregionalpersons.16.b:0 "I enjoyed our talks, but you must leave now"
 podregionalpersons.17.t:0 "The Last Cathar II"
 podregionalpersons.17.desc:0 "As you haven't kicked him out of your court yet, the young boy has started to see you as one of the few amenable [cainites|E] around. As such, he has brought forth the idea of letting the other refugees come into your service, which would undoubtedly help the prosperity of your realm.\nAnother course of action would be to capture and 'question' this boy until he reveals all he knows about the fabled treasure of Montsegur..."
 podregionalpersons.17.a:0 "Your people are welcome here"
 podregionalpersons.17.b:0 "Let's talk gold..."
 podregionalpersons.18.t:0 "The Monster"
 podregionalpersons.18.desc:0 "Someone... or something is prowling the streets of your city at night. And it is not one of your people. This thing has already been accused of mass murder, and of the most gruesome kind. Even some of your agents, as jaded as they are, seemed disturbed by the horrors they saw. Even darker rumors speak of experiments of the most unholy kind.\nThe city is cowering in fear and you have to act before people starts to investigate the nightly life a little too much. You could subtly alert the mortal Inquisition, hoping they would stop him. Or you could let him run amok for a while, and find a pattern in his madness. Finally, you could also double down on the patrols and guards at night, scaring him off to another, more vulnerable, town." 
 podregionalpersons.18.a:0 "Let Holy fight Unholy"
 podregionalpersons.18.custom:0 "This will expose you a little, but hopefully stop this monster"
 podregionalpersons.18.b:0 "There must be a method in his madness"
 podregionalpersons.18.customb:0 "The monster will continue his rampage, but perhaps a clue will emerge"
 podregionalpersons.18.c:0 "Scare him off"
 podregionalpersons.18.customc:0 "You will help the mortals guards at night, making sure he leave your city for good"
 podregionalpersons.19.t:0 "The Monster II"
 podregionalpersons.19.desc:0 "It backfired. Horribly.\nThe thing lurking in the night found the Inquisitorial cell you subtly launched to his trail and made an example out of them... a quite gruesome one, in the middle of the town.\nThe city is in panic, and you already hear reports of an elite team of God's agents on its way to cleanse the town. Even if it means burning it to the ground.\nAnd you still have not the faintest clue of who or what this thing is! Your court is in a frenzy, begging you to lay low and forget this damned endeavor before it is too late..." 
 podregionalpersons.19.a:0 "I will know the truth, even if I have to find it myself!"
 podregionalpersons.19.custom:0 "As the Inquisition closes down on your city, you continue your investigation..."

 podregionalpersons.20.t:0 "The Monster III"
 podregionalpersons.20.desc:0 "He found you. The monster that terrified your city, and got a whole army of Inquisitors running around is before you. A surprisingly average German man named Strohmann is looking quietly around at your uneasy courtiers.\n'I heard a lot about your kind. Fascinating really. I would love to learn more. Perhaps can we come to an agreement? I help you deal with those pesky Inquisitors and, in return, you tell me all there is to know about vampiric biology.'\nThis man is clearly unhinged, and even as a mortal, he is able to make most people unconformable. Which is something you could use..." 
 podregionalpersons.20.a:0 "An intriguing proposal"
 podregionalpersons.20.b:0 "It is the start of a beautiful friendship..."
 podregionalpersons.21.t:0 "The Monster II"
 podregionalpersons.21.desc:0 "It backfired. Horribly.\nYou haven't found any clue about the monster and, worse, he has started targeting your own people, with already one missing agent that you suspect won't come back. Or not in one piece.\nAs the bodies pile up, the city is in panic, and you already hear reports of an elite team of God's agents on its way to cleanse the town.

This Assamite has attacked a group of knights of the Seventh Crusade near your area of influence without your blessing. This behavior can't be tolerated, as it is certain to attract unwanted attention to your domain.\nBakr apologizes, and explains that he was freeing a young Muslim warrior, one that he intents to [Embrace|E]. He proposes a lump sum of gold to show that no disrespect towards you was intended. You could accept it... or you could take this enticing prospect as your own, despite not knowing much about him yet."

 podregionalpersons.23.desc:0 "You learned the name of the young man that you 'rescued' from Bakr, Tariq. Sadly, the crusaders also learned that their prisoner is now in your care, and they seem surprisingly hell bent on getting him back again. Enough that they now launched a full scale, quite reckless, assault on your domain.\nYou can try to fight them off, but you risk attracting unwanted attention even more with your supernatural prowess. Or you could leave Tariq to them and just forget this annoyance." 
 podregionalpersons.23.a:0 "I hope he is worth it..."

 podregionalpersons.24.desc:0 "You dealt with the crusaders counterattack quite well. What you didn't anticipate though was the sudden death of your bodyguards and the even more sudden aura of silence surrounding your tent. It is only broken by a faint 'I am taking back what is mine" as you suddenly realize that Bakr is here, and he hasn't forgotten that you stole his prospective childe.\nYou now have to deal with a powerful old Assamite bent on your destruction with only a young, if brave, mortal at your side..."

Many people, including Byzantine [cainites|E], are also fleeing the chaos and seeking refuge elsewhere.\nYou recently heard of such a caravan, traveling not far from your land. Like most refugees, they would be easy prey for your agents, and there is the perspective of stealing any riches they might carry with them.\nAnother course of action would be to welcome them at your court. A noble act, that could also bring new possibilities... nobody ever said that you are generous without a reason."

Though, one particular object has been hotly contested between your men during the sharing of the spoils.\nThis small piece of glass, perhaps from a mirror or a window, has a fascinating effect on people, as if calling to their very soul.
