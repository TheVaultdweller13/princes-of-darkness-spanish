 POD_elysium_events.14.desc:0 "The Elysium is a place of rumors and deceit. Nothing too important though, as most critical schemes take place in less public places, but there are still reputations to create or destroy here. One of your vassals is engaged in this vampiric art in a quite zealous manner tonight. This might be an opportunity to test yourself."

 POD_elysium_events.15.desc:0 "Tonight, your Elysium is very interested by one of the latest fade coming from the mortals. As always, many vampires claim that they are the precursor of such mortals' ideas and inventions, but without any proof. This is an endless debate, but one quite good as an opportunity to present your own theories without any real risk of danger."

 POD_elysium_events.16.t:0 "The Elysium : A Roaming Court?"
 POD_elysium_events.16.desc:0 "A tradition born from the German Ventrue, the roaming Elysium is the process of moving your court from holding to holding during several years, visiting all your 'subjects' along the way. Besides being a proposition favored by your vassals, it is also quite good for security purposes as you don't stay put in one place for too long. The drawback is your inability to efficiently control your own domain while you are away. Will you adopt this tradition for the next five years?"
 POD_elysium_events.16.option.a:0 "On the road again..."
 POD_elysium_events.16.option.b:0 "I'm a sedentary creature really"
   
 POD_elysium_events.17.t:0 "The Elysium : A Protege"
 POD_elysium_events.17.desc:0 "One of your vassals is very proud of a fine discovery [patronvassal.GetSheHe] recently made. A mortal apparently promising enough to be paraded around Elysium, which is a rare occasion... and not officially permitted. As the ruler here you could use this 'faux-pas' to grab this mortal for yourself if you so wish. Don't expect your vassal to forgive you soon though."
 POD_elysium_events.17.option.a:0 "I have great plans for you"
 POD_elysium_events.17.option.b:0 "Nice pet"
   
 POD_elysium_events.18.t:0 "The Elysium : Who is Caine?"
 POD_elysium_events.18.desc:0 "Caine's true nature has always been quite the debate in the vampiric community. As such, it is no real surprise that your Elysium is, once again, talking about him. Everyone has their own opinion about this subject, including you. Who was the first vampire? A savior, a monster, a simple mortal murderer or something else entirely?"
 POD_elysium_events.18.option.a:0 "Son of Adam and Eve, he was the first murderer"
 POD_elysium_events.18.option.b:0 "He is our bane, and our salvation" 
 POD_elysium_events.18.option.c:0 "A long gone nobody" 
 POD_elysium_events.18.option.d:0 "Perhaps a nice coach driver?" 

 POD_elysium_events.19.t:0 "The Elysium : Guest of Honor"
 POD_elysium_events.19.desc:0 "Before your next Elysium truly begins, one of your vassal comes to you with a request : being the guest of honor of the coming gathering. Obviously some petty scheming between your vassals is the reason of this demand and accepting would make look weak in front of the rest of your court. But accepting would mean that this one is indebted to you, which could prove useful."
 POD_elysium_events.19.option.a:0 "You owe me now"
 POD_elysium_events.19.option.b:0 "Not interested" 

 POD_elysium_events.20.t:0 "The Elysium : A Gift"
 POD_elysium_events.20.desc:0 "One of your vassals comes before you with a gift, apparently a family heirloom of some sort. It is a tempting offer, as you could either keep it as a vanity item or sell it for some useful money. But, obviously, nothing is truly given in the vampiric world. You are sure that there will be a price to pay later on for such generosity."
 POD_elysium_events.20.option.a:0 "Accept it then sell it"
 POD_elysium_events.20.option.b:0 "Accept it and keep it" 
 POD_elysium_events.20.option.c:0 "You can keep it" 

 POD_elysium_events.21.t:0 "The Elysium : The Second Generation"
 POD_elysium_events.21.desc:0 "Tonight's Elysium debate seems to be around the Second Generation. These mythical childer of Caine himself were, arguably, destroyed by their own progeny in the fabled city of Enoch. Some are contesting this theory though, or even the existence of such creatures altogether. What is your opinion?"
 POD_elysium_events.21.option.a:0 "They are long gone, killed by the Third Generation"
 POD_elysium_events.21.option.b:0 "They are a lesson in pride and fall"

 POD_elysium_events.109.desc:0 "Your advisor is asking for your help tonight in a training matter. A journey among the nearby courts to learn more about their traditions and quirks could result in a significant improvement. It would reflect poorly on you though, as you would admit that your council could be improved."

 POD_elysium_events.209.t:0 "Steward : Administrative Training?"

 POD_elysium_events.309.t:0 "Marshal : Warfare Training?"
 POD_elysium_events.309.desc:0 "Your advisor is asking for your help tonight in a training matter. New weapons of war have been invented by mortals, and studying them could prove insightful. Acquiring them would be costly though and require a large amount of bribes."

 POD_elysium_events.409.t:0 "Court Chaplain : Scholarly Training?"
 POD_elysium_events.409.desc:0 "Your advisor is asking for your help tonight in a training matter. Several important books have come to your advisor's attention and acquiring them could prove important. It would, of course, be quite costly to make sure that those writings end up in your possession."

 POD_elysium_events.509.t:0 "Spymaster : Shadowy Training?"
 POD_elysium_events.509.desc:0 "Your advisor is asking for your help tonight in a training matter. Several small opportunities have arisen in your area and your spymaster would like to pursue them to test some new ways of dealing with such matters. Being associated with such small scale scheming wouldn't look good for you though."

 POD_elysium_events.22.t:0 "The Elysium : The Stranger"
 POD_elysium_events.22.desc:0 "An unassuming vampire has come to your Elysium unexpected tonight. You don't know him and you don't owe him anything but he asks for your hospitality and the opportunity to discuss and debate with you and your courtiers before going on his way. Entertaining what seems like an errant nobody isn't exactly prestigious, but you get the feeling that he might be more interesting than he looks like."

Tonight he wants to play some board games with you and your court, including some that you didn't even knew the existence of. You are still pretty suspicious of this man, and your courtiers don't like him but you can't shake the feeling that it might be better to humor him."
 POD_elysium_events.23.option.a:0 "So what are the rules?"

 POD_elysium_events.24.desc:0 "The strange vampire that has came to your Elysium twice already is back. Tonight he seems taller and more formidable than before and doesn't ask for your hospitality. Instead he asks to speak to you privately. You feel compelled to agree, leading him to a remote part of your palace.\nThe man has an odd smile and simply says 'You are worthy' before giving you a small cup of blood. Before you can register anything else, he is already gone, leaving you with this small offering brimming with power."

 POD_elysium_events.26.t:0 "The Elysium : A Worthy Weapon?"
 POD_elysium_events.26.desc:0 "A mysterious stranger, who might not even be a vampire at all, has somehow appeared at your Elysium tonight. He goes straight to you with a proposal, gold against one of the weapons he is carrying.\nUninterested in anything else other than this potential trade, he nonetheless agrees to show them to you before committing to any decision. Even a quick glance is enough to see that these are the real deal, powerful and rare weapons indeed.\nThe stranger is awaiting impatiently your answer."
 POD_elysium_events.26.option.a:0 "This sword looks magnificent."
 POD_elysium_events.26.option.b:0 "A gladius! How retro!" 
 POD_elysium_events.26.option.c:0 "What's this strange thing?"
