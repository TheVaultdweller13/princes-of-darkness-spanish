 POD_survey_events.1000.t: "The Survey: An Escort?"
 POD_survey_events.1000.desc: "You are aware that, despite being nominally in your domain, there are dangers lurking outside of your seat of power. As you are preparing this important survey of your capital, you are wondering which, if any, escort to bring with you. Obviously, you don't want to make it look like you are afraid of traveling your own lands but you might be even more worried of a potential ambush or unexpected threat..."
 POD_survey_events.1000.option.a: "A whole army!"
 POD_survey_events.1000.option.b: "Some guards will be enough"
 POD_survey_events.1000.option.c: "They should be afraid of me, not the other way around"

 half_escort_survey_tooltip: "Probably a good balanced choice"

 POD_survey_events.1001.t: "The Survey: Where to?"
 POD_survey_events.1001.desc: "You are ready to go but the night isn't eternal (sadly), so you will have to choose which part of the city you will inspect tonight. Obviously, there are different opportunities and risks in every one of those. You will also limit your choice between areas where you have some assets to take care of, no need to wander aimlessly."
 POD_survey_events.1001.option.a: "A general sweep of my influence in town"
 POD_survey_events.1001.option.b: "Let us go to the military quarters"
 POD_survey_events.1001.option.c: "The merchant guilds perhaps?"

 POD_survey_events.1.t: "The Survey: A Patrol"
 POD_survey_events.1.desc: "During your tour of the city, you encounter a guard patrol probably from the militia. They are honestly a pitiful lot, their armor barely holding and their feet barely dragging them onward. It makes them quite easy to avoid and they don't bother you but this encounter gets you thinking that, maybe, you could increase your hold on the city by influencing some more of them.\nIt would be easy to do, but that would certainly not help the citizens' lot, barely protected by this parody of soldiers. On the other hand, you could withdraw the influence you already hold on them, hoping they improve over time without your interference."
 POD_survey_events.1.option.a: "More control is always better"
 POD_survey_events.1.option.b: "Perhaps I can ease up in this specific case"
 POD_survey_events.1.option.c: "Just pay for new uniforms"
 
 POD_survey_events.2.t: "The Survey: Homeless"
 POD_survey_events.2.desc: "As you travel the city, you realize that there are quite a lot of homeless mortals around just trying to survive in the streets. Those make for easy prey, but they don't help in improving the prestige of your domain. A novel idea comes to you, maybe you could make an 'investment'! Giving them some gold could help make them productive members of your cattle in time. Or you could just not bother, mortals will be mortals after all."
 POD_survey_events.2.option.a: "Here, to better serve me"
 POD_survey_events.2.option.b: "Easy prey is good enough"
 
 POD_survey_events.3.t: "The Survey: Recruits"
 POD_survey_events.3.desc: "Your hold over the military garrisoned in the city is good, but must always be maintained. Especially when new recruits are entering the training process as those newcomers are still free of your influence. As you approach the military quarter, you notice that they are doing a nocturnal drilling exercise which could be an opportunity. Perhaps you could introduce yourself?"
 POD_survey_events.3.option.a: "Consider me as your superior"
 POD_survey_events.3.option.b: "I won't bother these ones"
 POD_survey_events.3.option.c: "I will train these maggots myself!"

 survey_mercenaries_contact_modifier: "Mercenaries Contact"
 survey_mercenaries_contact_modifier_desc: "You have invested a lot in local mercenaries. It pays off."
 
 POD_survey_events.4.t: "The Survey: Mercenaries"
 POD_survey_events.4.desc: "Sellswords are a fact of life in these troubled times. You have been diligent enough to invest in your local ones for quite some time and you aren't surprised to see them tonight, loudly amusing themselves in the city's streets. If you are planning on some military adventures, investing even more in them could prove fruitful. Another option would be to scale back your hold on them for a while, as you are quite sure that the townsfolk aren't quite as thrilled to have so many rowdy ruffians parading in their midst unchallenged."
 POD_survey_events.4.option.a: "Friends, I have a new job for you!"
 POD_survey_events.4.option.b: "Stop annoying the neighbors please"
 
 POD_survey_events.5.t: "The Survey: Opportunities"
 POD_survey_events.5.desc: "Thanks to your considerable clout over the merchant class in town, you are often the first informed about new lucrative opportunities. And as any generous patron like yourself would, you don't hesitate to take your cut of any new business. One of your contacts warns you tonight about the latest news and how to best profit from it. He also says that this could be a great boon to the development of the city... but taking your deserved cut out of it could hinder it quite a lot. What will you do?"
 POD_survey_events.5.option.a: "I will invest in it"
 POD_survey_events.5.option.b: "Show me the money"
 POD_survey_events.5.option.c: "Show me ALL the money"
 auspexadvanced_tooltip: "This option is available because you have strong perception powers"

 POD_survey_events.6.t: "The Survey: New Guy"
 POD_survey_events.6.desc: "A new business has recently opened in your city and you were thinking about paying it a visit tonight. It is obviously just being helpful to let know any outsiders who is the real leader of the merchant quarter here. Still, you have doubts.\nYou noticed that, after your visit, most of these merchants somehow seem to lose the will to really work themselves to the bones for the better of your community. Perhaps you could try a new, bold, approach and just not interfere?"
 POD_survey_events.6.option.a: "Old methods work best"
 POD_survey_events.6.option.b: "Leave him alone"
 POD_survey_events.6.option.c: "Shake him up!"
 greedy_tooltip: "This option is available because you are a greedy bloodsucker"
 
 POD_survey_events.7.t: "The Survey: Men of Faith"
 POD_survey_events.7.desc: "The clergy is perhaps the hardest part of mortal society to influence. It only needs one of their members to have a strong faith to put your whole operation in jeopardy. Tonight, you have been informed that a troublesome preacher has come to make a rally in your town and he already has attracted quite a following. His diatribe against 'devils' and 'monsters' could be a potential danger... but removing it by force or otherwise would also have consequences."
 POD_survey_events.7.option.a: "No preacher in my city!"
 POD_survey_events.7.option.b: "He won't be a threat... right?"
 POD_survey_events.7.option.c: "Join the crowd masqueraded as a follower"
 obfuscateadvanced_tooltip: "This option is available because you have a strong mastery of Obfuscate"
  
 POD_survey_events.8.t: "The Survey: New Temple"
 POD_survey_events.8.desc: "Despite the good influence you have on the clergy of your domain, you have been unable to stop the planned construction of a new site of prayer nearby. You are now wandering close to it, looking with annoyance at the progressing construction site. Having even more men of faith in your area could be troublesome, as they are often quite capable of discerning your true nature. There is still time to make sure that the construction suffers some unfortunate setbacks though..."
 POD_survey_events.8.option.a: "Leave it alone"
 POD_survey_events.8.option.b: "Hire some ruffians"
 POD_survey_events.8.option.c: "Punch it hard!" 
 potenceadvanced_tooltip: "This option is available because your fists can cause literal earthquakes"

 POD_survey_events.9.title: "The Survey: Young Love"
 POD_survey_events.9.desc: "As you wander the noble quarter, you come across an interesting situation. From the street, a young man is trying to woo a young lady looking at him from her balcony. It doesn't seem very effective though, as he is stuttering a lot and his belle is soon closing her window, leaving him dejected.\nHe is clearly a son of the nobility, and that situation sounds like an easy, if unusual, possibility of gaining a new contact that could be useful in the future."
 POD_survey_events.9.option.a: "Give him some pointers"
 POD_survey_events.9.option.b: "Laugh at him"
 POD_survey_events.9.option.c: "Help bring about a happy ending" 
 
 POD_survey_events.10.t: "The Survey: The Law"
 POD_survey_events.10.desc: "You have some useful contacts in the mortal judiciary system of your city. From one of those you learned that a case is to be judged tonight, one including some ruffians that will probably get hanged for their misdeeds. The trouble is, these are 'your' ruffians and they could still be of use to you in making sure that the mortals of the area fall in line. Will you intervene to help them?"
 POD_survey_events.10.option.a: "Justice is blind"
 POD_survey_events.10.option.b: "I am the law!"

 POD_survey_events.11.t: "The Survey: The Thieves"
 POD_survey_events.11.desc: "Thanks to your contacts in the underworld of your city, you have been able to corner one successful group of thieves that has been plaguing the noble quarter for some time now. They are mere mortals and pose no threat to you but they could be of use. You are thinking of 'hiring' them, making sure a cut of their exploits comes back to you. Or you could just get rid of them, making the neighborhood safer for the foreseeable future."
 POD_survey_events.11.option.a: "You work for me now"
 POD_survey_events.11.option.b: "Let's stop this nonsense boys"
 
 POD_survey_events.12.t: "The Survey: The Thug"
 POD_survey_events.12.desc: "In spite of your influence in the underworld of the city, it seems one of the lowlifes didn't get the message. You are smirking as this thug is threatening you. Really, it's all so quaint that you are barely suppressing a laugh, which makes the thug visible agitated and closing in to you with what looks like a menacing glare. A refreshing distraction to be sure, but what to do now?"
 POD_survey_events.12.option.a: "Bleed him dry"
 POD_survey_events.12.option.b: "Make him work for you"
 POD_survey_events.12.option.c: "Time to reconsider your life choices"

 POD_survey_events.101.t: "The Survey: Uneventful Return"
 POD_survey_events.101.desc: "After your small tour of your city, you return to your [ROOT.Char.Custom('PODDomicile')] without any trouble. The night to night activity will soon grind back at your sanity but at least it has been refreshing to take a walk around."
 POD_survey_events.101.option.a: "Everything went well"

 POD_survey_events.110.t: "The Survey: The Assassin"
 POD_survey_events.110.desc: "You barely see it coming.\nAs you go back to your [ROOT.Char.Custom('PODDomicile')], the sound of an unsheathed dagger makes your turn around, just in time to see a shadowy figure way too close to your neck for comfort. A rival's agent? A long forgotten rival? You don't have time to ponder it as your would be murderer jumps towards you in a movement way too quick to be one of a mere mortal..."
 POD_survey_events.110.option.a: "Guards! To me!"
 survey_assassin_tooltip: "Your full escort will take care of this." 
 POD_survey_events.110.option.b: "Let's do this"
 POD_survey_events.110.effect.success.desc: "Overwhelmed, the assassin flees"
 POD_survey_events.110.critical.failure.effect.desc: "One wrong move..."
 POD_survey_events.110.critical.failure: "Blood and Darkness"
 POD_survey_events.110.option.d: "Run away!"

 POD_survey_events.111.t: "The Survey: The Assassin II"
 POD_survey_events.111.desc: "Overwhelmed by your strong defense, the assassin suddenly turns tails and starts to flee. In a reflexive move mostly driven by your vengeful Beast, you run after him. You are soon both moving at a supernatural speed and the chase brings you across streets, buildings and even rooftops. It is becoming quite hard to follow him, but you also see signs of exhaustion from your target. Perhaps his blood is running dry? Whatever the case, the chase ends and..."
 POD_survey_events.111.option.a: "...he escapes!"
 assassin_flees_tooltip: "He is too quick for you. Time to return home." 
 POD_survey_events.111.option.b: "...you caught him!"
 celerityadvanced_tooltip: "This option is available thanks to your powers of supernatural speed." 

 list_names_survey_modifier: "List of Names"
 list_names_survey_modifier_desc: "You know who they are. And you will find them."
 
 POD_survey_events.112.t: "The Survey: The Assassin III"
 POD_survey_events.112.desc: "You were closing on your hunter turned prey when, suddenly, the assassin turns his dagger on himself. Probably realizing that his escape was futile and imagining the very graphic things you would do to make him talk, he choose to end his own unlife.\nNot exactly the ending you wanted but after a quick scan through the ashes, you notice several piece of papers speaking of the contract on your head. They obviously don't list precisely who wants you dead, but are still quite enlightening..."
 POD_survey_events.112.option.a: "Better than nothing"
 
 POD_survey_events.120.t: "The Survey: The Fire"
 POD_survey_events.120.desc: "Why now? It is just mortal incompetence? Or an indirect attack by one of your rivals? No matter the culprit, a great fire has started spreading around your city and is close to encircling your position, making returning to your [ROOT.Char.Custom('PODDomicile')] a hazardous prospect.\nYour Beast already rages within its cage to just run like hell as you consider how to best avoid, or clear, the screaming mortals and the greedy fire. It won't be easy."
 POD_survey_events.120.option.a: "Guards! Clear a path!"
 beast_takeover_survey_tooltip: "Your frenzied Beast will take you to safety" 
 POD_survey_events.120.option.b: "I will find a way..."
 POD_survey_events.120.effect.success.desc: "You escape the worst of the inferno"
 POD_survey_events.120.critical.failure.effect.desc: "It ends as it started. In fire."
 POD_survey_events.120.critical.failure: "It burns! It burns!"
 POD_survey_events.120.option.d: "Let the Beast take over" 
 
 POD_survey_events.121.t: "The Survey: The Fire II"
 POD_survey_events.121.desc: "You managed to avoid the worst of the fire and the mortals are slowly clearing it out. Sadly, your escape route has put you quite far from your [ROOT.Char.Custom('PODDomicile')], too far for you to avoid the morning sun if you try to get there. As such, you have no choice but to find shelter in an undignified location until you can return to your seat of power the next night."
 POD_survey_events.121.option.a: "It's like a camping trip!"
 survey_fire_ending_tooltip: "You return home the next night feeling dirty, but still in one piece." 
 POD_survey_events.121.option.b: "I will just meld with the Earth"
 proteanadvanced_tooltip: "This option is available thanks to your mastery of Protean." 
 POD_survey_events.121.option.c: "Arrange for good accommodations"

 POD_survey_events.130.t: "The Survey: The Hunters"
 POD_survey_events.130.desc: "An ambush! On your way back to your [ROOT.Char.Custom('PODDomicile')], an apparently well organized (and informed) party of vampire hunters has encircled you. They are well armed and cautious in their approach, proving that this isn't their first hunt. Mortals are often not a concern, but such a group with torches, flaming arrows and probably one or two true believers is another matter entirely... You consider your options."
 POD_survey_events.130.option.a: "Guards! Deal with them!"
 best_bravely_tooltip: "They weren't expecting you to flee. You lose them easily but they will remember you." 
 POD_survey_events.130.option.b: "To battle!"
 POD_survey_events.130.effect.success.desc: "A decisive victory!"
 POD_survey_events.130.critical.failure.effect.desc: "It ends as it started. In fire."
 POD_survey_events.130.critical.failure: "It burns! It burns!"
 POD_survey_events.130.option.d: "Run away!" 

 POD_survey_events.131.t: "The Survey: The Hunters II"
 POD_survey_events.131.desc: "Victory is yours. You help yourself on the blood of these mortals, as they won't need it anymore, and think of what to do with the wounded survivors of this assault now at your mercy. Bringing them back to your [ROOT.Char.Custom('PODDomicile')] for a 'demonstration' in front of your court seems like a nice relaxing option. Or you could go for a more public display in a central part of your city but this is sure to come to the attention of more hunters in the future though."
 POD_survey_events.131.option.a: "A private display sounds good"
 POD_survey_events.131.option.b: "Dominate them to get others off your trail"
 POD_survey_events.131.option.c: "Time to make an example"
  
 POD_survey_events.140.t: "The Survey: The Prophet"
 POD_survey_events.140.desc: "As you return home to your [ROOT.Char.Custom('PODDomicile')], you are accosted by an old man mumbling what seems like incoherent babble. You can make out words like 'vampires' and 'God' though, which catch your attention. As you slow down a little, the madman gets closer and starts talking even more excitedly than before. Even with paying attention, understanding a shred of what he is trying to say would be quite the feat still."
 POD_survey_events.140.option.a: "I stay a while, and listen"
 ending_survey_tooltip: "You return home without any more hindrance." 
 POD_survey_events.140.option.b: "I don't listen to any madman"
 POD_survey_events.140.effect.success.desc: "That makes sense, somewhat"
 POD_survey_events.140.critical.failure.effect.desc: "I don't get it..."
 POD_survey_events.140.critical.failure: "Not a clue!"

 POD_survey_events.141.t: "The Survey: The Prophet II"
 POD_survey_events.141.desc: "Well it was... not exactly 'enlightening' but there is at least some interesting things to ponder about what this old man said. Though the always cryptic natures of such prophecies make them not really worth the while most of the time. In any case, the self proclaimed prophet is happy that you have listened and has left you alone. Your [ROOT.Char.Custom('PODDomicile')] awaits, with more questions than answers."
 POD_survey_events.141.option.a: "Just rambling really"
 malkavian_survey_tooltip: "This option is available because you are a Malkavian" 
 POD_survey_events.141.option.b: "Questions are the point!"
 POD_survey_events.141.option.c: "No really, this was crystal clear"
