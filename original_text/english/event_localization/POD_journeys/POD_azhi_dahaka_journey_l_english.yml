 POD_azhi_dahaka_journey.1.desc: "Azhi Dahaka is Persian for the three-headed dragon of the demon Ahriman. To the Tzimisce, it is the Metamorphosist’s Holy Grail, an enlightened and ultimate state of being, possibly brought on by extensive use of Vicissitude.\nYour studies have confirmed your first impression, there isn't one way to Azhi Dahaka but many. You will have to forge your own and avoid the mistakes of those who fell before."

 POD_azhi_dahaka_journey.2.t: "Azhi Dahaka: The Dragon"
 POD_azhi_dahaka_journey.2.desc: "Azhi Dahaka, Dracon, Illuyankas, Dracula and Leviathan; all dragons. You wonder why this beast in particular factors so heavily in Tzimisce's mythology. It’s simple, really. Since humanity’s infancy, dragons have plagued its legends. The kine feared these great serpents, but to the Tzimisce, they represented grand change. Dragons are harbingers of transformation at the edge of chaos and forever in motion with spiraling and sinuous forms. It is not their appearance that appeals to you, but their potential for chrysalis — and beyond. They are living embodiments of a change we have yet to truly realize.\nThey are the first road towards your ascension."

 POD_azhi_dahaka_journey.3.t: "Azhi Dahaka"
 POD_azhi_dahaka_journey.3.desc: "As a rule, with a few notable exceptions, Tzimisce do not tend towards devoted piety. Why worship some distant god when you can craft yourself into one? Not really a deity. Not really a dogma. Azhi Dahaka is the symbol, fetish, and focus of the Clan’s transcendentalism.\nFrom the Dracon to Illuyankas, Dracula to the Leviathan, dragons are woven deeply into Tzimisce's mythology. What the kine fear, we aspire towards — not the literal, physical form, but what the dragon represents as a harbinger of transformation. We quest for the transcendental, walking the sinuous spiral of Azhi Dahaka’s coils, gazing into its many mouths and eyes. Where chaos and forever meet in motion, that is where we will find the dragon’s beating heart, and we will drink deep.\nMetaphor made manifest. Riddle made flesh. Azhi Dahaka is the chiropteran cherub of our godless, alien spirituality.\nAnd now it is yours."

 POD_azhi_dahaka_journey.4.t: "Azhi Dahaka?"
 POD_azhi_dahaka_journey.4.desc: "Azhi Dahaka is not some Nirvana where the Metamorphosist achieves oneness with the universe, but rather the opposite — to undergo Metamorphosis is to completely separate oneself from Creation, to be a self-sufficient will in a universe that holds no more power over the ego.\nSome believe so, anyway. Metamorphosis is a lonely pursuit. Did you truly achieve it? Or did you just lose yourself in a maelstrom of eternal change?"
