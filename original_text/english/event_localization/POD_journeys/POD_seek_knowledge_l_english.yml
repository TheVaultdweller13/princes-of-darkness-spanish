 POD_demon_lore_learning_events.1.desc: "Lores are the remnants of the divine abilities that demons possessed as Elohim. A Celestial House's Lore is nothing less than the collected secrets of the universe, evocations that encompass the foundations of reality and govern the forces that keep it in motion. Prior to the Fall, each House had its own specific sets of Lore that reflected its duties within the angelic hierarchy. These evocations were considered the heart of each House, and they were guarded jealously as a matter of pragmatism, and many among the Fallen exchanged bits of their Lore with one another to gain whatever advantage they could against their more hidebound foes."
