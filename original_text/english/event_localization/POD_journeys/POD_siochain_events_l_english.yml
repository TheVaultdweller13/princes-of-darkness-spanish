 POD_siochain.1.t: "World of Grey"
 POD_siochain.1.desc: "The Autumn World has revealed itself to me.\n\nBanality is necessary. Without shadow, there would be no light. Without an outline, there would be no shapes. And Banality is what gives shape to the raw, unfettered chaos of the Dreaming.\n\nWith this understanding, I've gained one piece of the puzzle. But there's more to learn, still."
 POD_siochain.1.a: "One step closer to perfection."
 POD_siochain.1.a.tooltip: "You can now move on to the next step of your [journey|E]: contemplating the Dreaming."

 POD_siochain.2.t: "World of Color"
 POD_siochain.2.desc: "The Dreaming has revealed itself to me.\n\nCreativity means letting go. It means being open to whatever may come my way, whether good or bad, whether joy or grief, whether success or failure.\n\nIt makes sense in isolation, but can this insight coexist with Banality?"
 POD_siochain.2.a.tooltip: "You can now move on to the final step of your [journey|E]: integrating both aspects of your soul."

 POD_siochain.3.t: "The Eye of the Storm"
 POD_siochain.3.desc: "I meditate to summon the two halves of my being, and the very air starts screaming.\n\nFlighty Glamour, tugging at me, yearning to run free. And heavy Banality, rooting me to the spot, unyielding, merciless.\n\nThere's flashes of something there. Some half-forgotten insight, like a word at the tip of my tongue that I can't remember. It's there. I know it. And I'm about to lose it..."
 POD_siochain.3.a.tooltip: "This is the moment of truth. Stay calm. Be patient."
 POD_siochain.3.a.success: "You succeed"
 POD_siochain.3.a.failure: "You fail"

 POD_siochain.4.t: "The Calm after the Storm"
 POD_siochain.4.desc: "I didn't know the tension could get so much worse. It's about to rip me apart.\n\nAnd then it doesn't.\n\nI burst into laughter because it's so obvious now. Balance isn't the destination. Balance is a process. And that process is me.\n\nI feel more alive than I've ever felt before. My muscles are flexing and my mind is racing with new possibilities, and I feel present, truly present, for the first time in my life."
 POD_siochain.4.a: "I've been born anew."
 POD_siochain.4.a.tooltip: "You achieved something thought impossible."

 POD_siochain.5.t: "Devastation"
 POD_siochain.5.desc: "I didn't know the tension could get so much worse. It's about to rip me apart.\n\nAnd then it does.\n\nMy faerie soul shrinks like a frightened animal in the face of Banality, oh majestic Banality, soul-crushing Banality. The great emptiness. The cold, uncaring lord of this universe.\n\nWhat was I thinking, going up against this force of nature? All the color has left the world. It's over. I'm thinking..."
 POD_siochain.5.a: "...It's not over yet!"
 POD_siochain.5.a.tooltip: "It takes all of your strength to overcome Banality, but you will recover, in time."
 POD_siochain.5.b: "...So there was no hope from the start..."
 POD_siochain.5.b.tooltip: "You fall into Banality..."
 dauntain_work_in_progress: "Dauntain are not implemented in [princes_of_darkness|E] yet!"

 POD_siochain.6.t: "A Grey Odyssey"
 POD_siochain.6.desc.1: "Banality is like an ocean. It's, like, so big."
 POD_siochain.6.desc.2: "Banality is like a donkey. It's very fuzzy."
 POD_siochain.6.desc.3: "Banality is like a proud knight, if he wasn't very proud."
 POD_siochain.6.desc.4: "Banality is like colors that don't have any color."
 POD_siochain.6.desc.5: "Banality is like a one-way street that goes both ways."
 POD_siochain.6.desc: "\n\nWow, that was a terrible metaphor. I used to be better at these. Where did my creative spark go? I must've lost it after spending so much time in the Autumn World.\n\nI think I lost something else. What was it? I can't remember..."
 POD_siochain.6.a: "What's a \"dreamer\"?"
 POD_siochain.6.a.tooltip: "Your quest to understand Banality has detached you from your Dreamers..."

 POD_siochain.7.t: "A Colorful Odyssey"
 POD_siochain.7.desc: "Glamour is intoxicating. Who cares about what is \"real\" when you can turn pure fantasy into something you can see, and taste, and touch?\n\nAm I overdoing it? No way. This is important for my development.\n\nSampling all these chimerical delights has made it harder to use Cantrips for other things. But that's probably normal."
 POD_siochain.7.a: "So this is what purple tastes like."
