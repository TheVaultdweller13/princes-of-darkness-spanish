 POD_golconda_journey.1.t: "In Search of Answers"
 POD_golconda_journey.1.desc: "[teacher.GetFirstName] meets me in a secluded garden, away from prying eyes. [teacher.GetHerHis|U] voice is low, but [teacher.GetHerHis] eyes are shining.\n\n[teacher.GetSheHe|U] tells me of Redemption.\n\nFirst promised to [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('505001').GetFirstName] by Gabriel, messenger of God. First achieved by [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('505008').GetFirstNameNicknamed]. A state sought by many, and reached by few.\n\nThe name of this redemption is [GetTrait('golconda').GetName(GetNullCharacter)]."
 POD_golconda_journey.1.option.a: "We talk until the early hours of the morning..."

 POD_golconda_journey.2.t: "A Journey of a Thousand Steps"
 POD_golconda_journey.2.desc: "[teacher.GetFirstName] tries to explain the path to [golconda|E] with a long series of vague metaphors, each of them more esoteric and confusing than the last. I #italic think#! I understand the general gist of it, though.\n\nGolconda is, in some ways, a return to Humanity. A [cainite|E] who walks the path #X must never let their Humanity slip by committing murder or theft#!.\n\nFurthermore, #X frenzy has to be avoided at all costs#!. Having a high [piety_level|E] on one's [Concept('faith','Road')|E] can weaken the influence of [the_beast|E].\n\nWhen [teacher.GetFirstName] bids me farewell, I am lost deep in thought."
 POD_golconda_journey.2.effect: "You learned of [golconda|E] and unlocked the [journey|E] to make peace with your [beast|E]."
 POD_golconda_journey.2.option.a: "Now I know what I must do."


 POD_golconda_journey.10.t: "A Trickle of Insights"
 POD_golconda_journey.10.desc: "I seclude myself in my haven and think on what I've learned.\n\n"
 POD_golconda_journey.10.desc.1: "[the_beast|E] is powerful. Indeed, some [Concept('faith','Roads')|E] will try to harness its power by #beast surrendering#! to it, their adherents slipping further and further away from Humanity, heedless of the consequences.\n\nOf course, the path of [golconda|E] is fundamentally incompatible with such an approach. Yet [the_beast|E] will accept nothing but complete #beast surrender#!. Could it be convinced to enter an equal partnership?"
 POD_golconda_journey.10.desc.2: "[the_beast|E] is #beast hungry#!. The Beast is #beast hunger#! itself.\n\nBut what #italic is#! #beast hunger#!? Just a survival instinct. A reminder that every creature in this world needs to #beast feed#!.\n\nYet what the Beast demands goes way beyond what's necessary for survival. Something doesn't add up."
 POD_golconda_journey.10.desc.3: "[the_beast|E] is impulsive. It tugs at me constantly, demanding I #beast drink#! my courtiers, my peers, my friends, everyone I meet, everyone I hold dear.\n\nYet it is also cunning. In my observations, I have seen evidence of its intelligence. So it can plan ahead.\n\nWhich begs the question: are all its seemingly impulsive demands in service of some greater purpose?"
 POD_golconda_journey.10.desc.4: "[the_beast|E] is a #beast curse#!. Many would say by God himself or some other entity of such power, but the details don't really matter.\n\nIt can never be trusted, bargained with or even coerced. Whether it is a foreign invader or a dark reflection is of no consequence because, in the end, it is a test.\n\nUnderstanding this test and how to overcome it might be the key to everything."
 POD_golconda_journey.10.desc.5: "[the_beast|E] is primeval. Man was #beast savage#! once, and all the modern trappings of "civilization" are clumsily trying to hide the brutality inherent to man's existence.\n\nMortals don't hear [the_beast|E] as we do but they certainly feel its effects, explaining the #beast violence#! of their world. Vampires, as creatures stuck in eternal stasis, are closer to this primeval state of affairs and as such hear the call for violence much more clearly.\n\nGolconda is perhaps the true next step of one's evolution, where the #beast savagery#! of humanity's birth can finally be left behind."
 POD_golconda_journey.10.desc.6: "[the_beast|E] is I. Many would balk at such a notion but few can deny the raw #beast allure#! of its whispers. How could such an #beast allure#! be born if not by being a dark reflection of one's persona? As vampires know very well, the best tempters know everything about their prey.\n\nMoving on from this realization is no small matter however. One can not simply remove a part of themselves without losing much in the process, which leaves only one course of action, terrifying in its simplicity.\n\nAcceptance.\n\nI am [the_beast|E] and [the_beast|E] is me."
 POD_golconda_journey.10.desc.7: "[the_beast|E] is seductive. Like the serpent in the first garden, it offers enticing promises, simple solutions and easy ways out. And, still like the serpent, those are all roads to #beast damnation#!.\n\nIf vampirism was indeed a Biblical curse of some sort, there can be no simple solution, no magical power to undo everything.\n\nThe answer can only lie on a long road of self-atonement, far from the bestial #beast cravings#! of our kind. On this lonely road, there is only one companion, [the_beast|E] trying to make us fall every step of the way. We just have to decline its tempting offers.\n\nEve only had to decline the serpent's ones, after all."
 POD_golconda_journey.10.desc.8: "[the_beast|E] is Prometheus. The firebringer that saved humanity from slavery to the Gods but also condemned it to burn itself again and again. It fuels my powers, crushes my enemies and protects me from the horrors in the dark.\n\nBut it also makes me a monster, a Slaver-God that enthralls humanity for my own perverted #beast pleasure#! and repeats the never ending cycle. Perhaps to break it means simply to stop relying on it.\n\nBut what am I without the #beast power#! that set me free?"
 POD_golconda_journey.10.desc.9: "[the_beast|E] is an illusion. A fabrication of our own mind to rationalize the horrors we #beast unleash#! upon humanity. The mere existence of Golconda, and the fact that those that attain it are rumored to be free of it, proves that [the_beast|E] is a myth so deeply ingrained into the [cainites|E]' psyche that it has become its own form of reality.\n\nThe voices in my head, the dark #beast urge#! to drink, kill, maim, are just that, fragments of a predatory mindset that can be curtailed with enough willpower."

 POD_golconda_journey.10.option.a: "Each answer is leading to even more questions."
 POD_golconda_journey.10.option.a.success: "You have a breakthrough in your understanding of [the_beast|E]."
 
 POD_golconda_journey.11.t: "Gazing into the Abyss"
 POD_golconda_journey.11.desc: "Something is different this time.\n\nAs I sit and contemplate, I become very relaxed. My awareness follows the sensations in my body, the flow of vitae in my veins. And suddenly, I notice it.\n\nLike the tiniest pinprick of searing hot pain. An indistinct ache floating through my heart's blood.\n\nIt's made of... memories? And #beast hunger#!.\n\nI feel absolutely certain. This is where [the_beast|E] resides. If I roused my blood, I could unlock whatever it is hiding. And I could finally confront it, eye to eye."
 POD_golconda_journey.11.effect: "You have unlocked the Suspire as a [journey|E]."
 POD_golconda_journey.11.option.a: "The question is... am I ready?"

 POD_golconda_journey.100.desc: "I lock the doors to my haven one last time, thinking about the events that led me here.\n\n"
 POD_golconda_journey.100.desc.compassion: "In everything I do, I try to see the best in others. And I've endeavored to extend that same compassion to [the_beast|E], yet it's not making it easy.\n\nCan I show compassion to #beast blind hunger#!? The more I try to understand its motives, the more inscrutable it seems.\n\nI can only hope that confronting it head-on will lead to the answers I seek."
 POD_golconda_journey.100.desc.selfreliance: "I've learned early on that others can't be trusted. That is the way of the world. Naivete will destroy a [cainite|E] as surely as sunlight.\n\nNo one can help me on this quest. If I want to confront [the_beast|E], the responsibility falls squarely on me.\n\nI know what I need to do, and I have the determination to do it."

 POD_golconda_journey.101.desc: "Pain.\n\nI'm caught in a maelstrom of deafening colors. Discordant noises are leaving metallic aftertastes on my tongue.

 POD_golconda_journey.102.t: "Floating"
 POD_golconda_journey.102.desc: "The chaos around me quiets down, if only a little. Shapes are rearranging themselves into geometric order. Like an endless series of mirrors, I see myself repeated in them.\n\nThey're like a microcosm of my past. All my memories of joys and hurts, pride and regret, disappointment and relief.\n\nFrom this distance, they look so small and insignificant."

 POD_golconda_journey.103.desc: "The illusions shatter, and I find myself in a river valley.\n\nThe sun is shining. I had already forgotten what it's like to receive its warmth. Words cannot describe the feeling.\n\nA man is standing at the riverbank. The lifeless body of his brother is splayed out before him, blood from a head wound spilling unceremoniously into the waters.\n\nThe man's face is blank. Yet an intense sense of recognition overcomes me. I know exactly what he feels."

 POD_golconda_journey.104.desc.guilt: "It's his guilt.\n\nHe was labeled a sinner, yet was offered no realistic chance at redemption, even as the millennia went on."
 POD_golconda_journey.104.desc.confusion: "It's his confusion.\n\nIt's his feeling of powerlessness at having the rules changed on him, and wondering for millennia whether anything could make him feel powerful again."
 POD_golconda_journey.104.desc.rage: "It's his rage.\n\nHe offered love, and received millennia of punishment in return."
 POD_golconda_journey.104.desc.end: "\n\nAnd I realize — none of these feelings are mine. They are his, and they are his to keep.\n\nYet their weight is about to drown me."
 POD_golconda_journey.104.option.a.tt: "You will try to stave off frenzy one last time."

 POD_golconda_journey.105.desc: "I wake. Reality unblurs and slowly comes back into focus, taking its sweet time.\n\nI am absolutely covered in vitae. It must've oozed out of my pores while my mind was off on its vision quest.\n\nThe sight of it would be enough to send any [cainite|E] into a frenzy. But nothing stirs inside me. No inner voice urging me to drink it all up.\n\nJust silence."
