 POD_golconda_journey.2.t:0 "A Journey of a Thousand Steps"
 POD_golconda_journey.2.desc:0 "[teacher.GetFirstName] tries to explain the path to [golconda|E] with a long series of vague metaphors, each of them more esoteric and confusing than the last. I #italic think#! I understand the general gist of it, though.\n\nGolconda is, in some ways, a return to Humanity. A [cainite|E] who walks the path #X must never let their Humanity slip by committing murder or theft#!.\n\nFurthermore, #X frenzy has to be avoided at all costs#!. Having a high [piety_level|E] on one's [Concept('faith','Road')|E] can weaken the influence of [the_beast|E].\n\nWhen [teacher.GetFirstName] bids me farewell, I am lost deep in thought."

 POD_golconda_journey.10.t:0 "A Trickle of Insights"
 POD_golconda_journey.10.desc:0 "I seclude myself in my haven and think on what I've learned.\n\n"
 POD_golconda_journey.10.desc.1:0 "[the_beast|E] is powerful. Indeed, some [Concept('faith','Roads')|E] will try to harness its power by #R surrendering#! to it, their adherents slipping further and further away from Humanity, heedless of the consequences.\n\nOf course, the path of [golconda|E] is fundamentally incompatible with such an approach. Yet [the_beast|E] will accept nothing but complete #R surrender#!. Could it be convinced to enter an equal partnership?"
 POD_golconda_journey.10.desc.2:0 "[the_beast|E] is #R hungry#!. The Beast is #R hunger#! itself.\n\nBut what #italic is#! #R hunger#!? Just a survival instinct. A reminder that every creature in this world needs to #R feed#!.\n\nYet what the Beast demands goes way beyond what's necessary for survival. Something doesn't add up."
 POD_golconda_journey.10.desc.3:0 "[the_beast|E] is impulsive. It tugs at me constantly, demanding I #R drink#! my courtiers, my peers, my friends, everyone I meet, everyone I hold dear.\n\nYet it is also cunning. In my observations, I have seen evidence of its intelligence. So it can plan ahead.\n\nWhich begs the question: are all its seemingly impulsive demands in service of some greater purpose?"
 POD_golconda_journey.10.desc.4:0 "[the_beast|E] is a #R curse#!. Many would say by God himself or some other entity of such power, but the details don't really matter.\n\nIt can never be trusted, bargained with or even coerced. Whether it is a foreign invader or a dark reflection is of no consequence because, in the end, it is a test.\n\nUnderstanding this test and how to overcome it might be the key to everything."
 POD_golconda_journey.10.desc.5:0 "[the_beast|E] is primeval. Man was #R savage#! once, and all the modern trappings of "civilization" are clumsily trying to hide the brutality inherent to man's existence.\n\nMortals don't hear [the_beast|E] as we do but they certainly feel its effects, explaining the #R violence#! of their world. Vampires, as creatures stuck in eternal stasis, are closer to this primeval state of affairs and as such hear the call for violence much more clearly.\n\nGolconda is perhaps the true next step of one's evolution, where the #R savagery#! of humanity's birth can finally be left behind."
 POD_golconda_journey.10.desc.6:0 "[the_beast|E] is I. Many would balk at such a notion but few can deny the raw #R allure#! of its whispers. How could such an #R allure#! be born if not by being a dark reflection of one's persona? As vampires know very well, the best tempters know everything about their prey.\n\nMoving on from this realization is no small matter however. One can not simply remove a part of themselves without losing much in the process, which leaves only one course of action, terrifying in its simplicity.\n\nAcceptance.\n\nI am [the_beast|E] and [the_beast|E] is me."
 POD_golconda_journey.10.desc.7:0 "[the_beast|E] is seductive. Like the serpent in the first garden, it offers enticing promises, simple solutions and easy ways out. And, still like the serpent, those are all roads to #R damnation#!.\n\nIf vampirism was indeed a Biblical curse of some sort, there can be no simple solution, no magical power to undo everything.\n\nThe answer can only lie on a long road of self-atonement, far from the bestial #R cravings#! of our kind. On this lonely road, there is only one companion, [the_beast|E] trying to make us fall every step of the way. We just have to decline its tempting offers.\n\nEve only had to decline the serpent's ones, after all."
 POD_golconda_journey.10.desc.8:0 "[the_beast|E] is Prometheus. The firebringer that saved humanity from slavery to the Gods but also condemned it to burn itself again and again. It fuels my powers, crushes my enemies and protects me from the horrors in the dark.\n\nBut it also makes me a monster, a Slaver-God that enthralls humanity for my own perverted #R pleasure#! and repeats the never ending cycle. Perhaps to break it means simply to stop relying on it.\n\nBut what am I without the #R power#! that set me free?"
 POD_golconda_journey.10.desc.9:0 "[the_beast|E] is an illusion. A fabrication of our own mind to rationalize the horrors we #R unleash#! upon humanity. The mere existence of Golconda, and the fact that those that attain it are rumored to be free of it, proves that [the_beast|E] is a myth so deeply ingrained into the [cainites|E]' psyche that it has become its own form of reality.\n\nThe voices in my head, the dark #R urge#! to drink, kill, maim, are just that, fragments of a predatory mindset that can be curtailed with enough willpower."

 POD_golconda_journey.11.desc:0 "Something is different this time.\n\nAs I sit and contemplate, I become very relaxed. My awareness follows the sensations in my body, the flow of vitae in my veins. And suddenly, I notice it.\n\nLike the tiniest pinprick of searing hot pain. An indistinct ache floating through my heart's blood.\n\nIt's made of... memories? And #R hunger#!.\n\nI feel absolutely certain. This is where [the_beast|E] resides. If I roused my blood, I could unlock whatever it is hiding. And I could finally confront it, eye to eye."

 POD_golconda_journey.100.desc.selfreliance:0 "I've learned early on that others can't be trusted. That is the way of the world.
