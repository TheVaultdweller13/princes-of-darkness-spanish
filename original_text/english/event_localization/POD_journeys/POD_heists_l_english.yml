Apparently a champion with no equal, [knight.GetHerHis] battlefield prowess and brave heroics in the service of [knight.GetHerHis] liege are the stuff of legends if you can truly believe them.\nAll of this seems fairly inconsequential to your own quest until you are cornered and pressured into telling your own tale about this champion. Creating a fanciful story on the spot shouldn't be that hard. Right?"

Sadly, I've also attracted the attention of [marshal.GetFirstNameNicknamed], who has been listening to my increasingly convoluted speech about warfare for a while now.\nI fear the worst when [marshal.GetSheHe] finally extracts me from the crowd of courtiers but am soon relieved to hear that [marshal.GetSheHe] simply wants to test [marshal.GetHerHis] skills against mine in a board game.\nNo time to let my guard down however, board games are notorious for loosening up tongues and I don't want to let slip my true purpose here."

#  POD_heists.1081.desc:0 "Infiltrating a foreign court might sound like a good idea on paper but, on practice, the "foreign" part of it can cause quite a lot of issues. You are pretty sure that you broke several unsaid traditions since you arrived there, which isn't helping your attempts to stay inconspicuous.\nTaking a little time to acclimate yourself before diving headfirst into your heist might be a wise choice."

You wager that starting to ask questions about your target would only make things worse and, as such, you are considering another option.\nThere are a large number of servants running around, completing menial tasks that most people don't even acknowledge the existence of.

You start to question them for the location of your target but most of them avoid you.\nFinally, a young woman comes to you, offering to help locate your prize if you accept to take her young boy with you. It seems the master of servants here is a cruel man and she fears for her boy's life."

He has noticed the disappearance of his charges and has been roaming the place until he finally found you.\nHe is far from a physical threat to you but his entourage of guards are a little more so.
