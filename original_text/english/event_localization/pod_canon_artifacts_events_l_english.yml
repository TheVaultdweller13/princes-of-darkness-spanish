 POD_canon_artifacts.100.desc:0 "You know the stories. The weapon you are carrying is perhaps the most infamous one in the world. The Sword of Nul was created long ago as a receptacle for the powerful demon Drakonskyr in ancient Sumer. Just before being finally freed upon the mortal world, he was thwarted by a vampire named Tiamat who trapped him in her own body, then threw the cursed sword away.\nSince then, it has always tried to be reunited with its master and most of its owners are known to meet an untimely death if they don't comply with the demon's pull at one point or another..."

 POD_canon_artifacts.101.desc:0 "As you answered its pull, you quickly realize that the Sword of Nul cares not at all about your well being. It drives you towards its master's resting place relentlessly, even trying to keep you awake during the day. As such, you are going from danger to danger, be they dark forests, the lack of blood or the trouble of finding a resting place in strange lands.\nAt this rate, you will join the long list of the Sword's casualties, you need to slow down and plan a course of action before it's too late."

There is a slight issue though, the demon is resting in a trap filled maze to deter any unwanted intruders.\nObviously, you have the Sword, so you can just 'follow' its lead to avoid the majority of dangers in there. But there is always the risk of a wrong turn... No turning back now though, since you are almost certain that the Sword will attack you if you take step back at this point."

The infernal lord is all sweet and honey, thanking you for freeing him and promising rich rewards for your help.\nYou quickly assess that it's too late to oppose him now, as with the Sword of Nul at his side he is way too strong even for you, so you consider your options.\nOn one hand, Drakonskyr offers to give you the content of the treasure in this tomb and letting you keep the Sword, after having pulled his essence from it obviously. On the other, the demon tries to entice you with the possibility of becoming his new host, with the promise of eternal power if you were both 'working together'."

You see civilizations rise and fall and Cainites far older than you battling each other in unending wars...

 POD_canon_artifacts.900.desc:0 "Some research has confirmed that the book you are holding in your hands contains the secret necromantic knowledge of the Iovanus family, most commonly known nowadays as the Giovanni. This codex was made by a rebel member of their line long before they became vampires and held by him ever since, mostly in an act of spite against the family that took everything from him.\nThis man, Aurelius Flavius Iovianus, bound the soul of his murdered wife, Titia Sabina, to the book in an effort to save her and also create powerful guardian for the codex. This effort paid off very well and you are convinced that you can't access the content of the book without Titia's approval.\nA direct conflict would be unwise as you gathered that Tinia has several [Fetters|E] in this world so she could easily destroy the book if you tried a hostile action against her. Shrewd diplomacy seems to be the only way forward."
