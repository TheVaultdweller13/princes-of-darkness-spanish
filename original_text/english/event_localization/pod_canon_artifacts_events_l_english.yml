 POD_canon_artifacts.100.t: "The Sword Calls"
 POD_canon_artifacts.100.desc: "You know the stories. The weapon you are carrying is perhaps the most infamous one in the world. The Sword of Nul was created long ago as a receptacle for the powerful demon Drakonskyr in ancient Sumer. Just before being finally freed upon the mortal world, he was thwarted by a vampire named Tiamat who trapped him in her own body, then threw the cursed sword away.\nSince then, it has always tried to be reunited with its master and most of its owners are known to meet an untimely death if they don't comply with the demon's pull at one point or another..."
 POD_canon_artifacts.100.a: "I won't be ordered around by a sword!"

 POD_canon_artifacts.101.t: "The Sword Calls II"
 POD_canon_artifacts.101.desc: "As you answered its pull, you quickly realize that the Sword of Nul cares not at all about your well being. It drives you towards its master's resting place relentlessly, even trying to keep you awake during the day. As such, you are going from danger to danger, be they dark forests, the lack of blood or the trouble of finding a resting place in strange lands.\nAt this rate, you will join the long list of the Sword's casualties, you need to slow down and plan a course of action before it's too late."

 POD_canon_artifacts.102.desc: "You are finally close to Drakonskyr's resting place and you can almost feel the Sword of Nul brimming with anticipation. There is a slight issue though, the demon is resting in a trap filled maze to deter any unwanted intruders.\nObviously, you have the Sword, so you can just 'follow' its lead to avoid the majority of dangers in there. But there is always the risk of a wrong turn... No turning back now though, since you are almost certain that the Sword will attack you if you take step back at this point."

 POD_canon_artifacts.103.desc: "It is done, you are finally standing in front of Tiamat-Drakonskyr. The demon has awoken himself from torpor, warned of your coming by his faithful Sword. The infernal lord is all sweet and honey, thanking you for freeing him and promising rich rewards for your help.\nYou quickly assess that it's too late to oppose him now, as with the Sword of Nul at his side he is way too strong even for you, so you consider your options.\nOn one hand, Drakonskyr offers to give you the content of the treasure in this tomb and letting you keep the Sword, after having pulled his essence from it obviously. On the other, the demon tries to entice you with the possibility of becoming his new host, with the promise of eternal power if you were both 'working together'."
 POD_canon_artifacts.103.a: "Hell no!"

 POD_canon_artifacts.300.desc: "The Eye of Hazimel is a malevolent relic of shrouded origins, known to grant great powers to anyone who would replace his own eye by it, but also to extract a great mental toll. Some have lost themselves in the madness of the visions given by it and the Eye itself seems to relish transforming its host into an extension of its corrupting will.\nSo far you have resisted its call, leaving it safely encased in a sealed box, but the temptation is ever present. Maybe you are strong enough to harness its powers without losing yourself?...or maybe this arrogant feeling is a delusion shared by the Eye to entice you."

 POD_canon_artifacts.301.desc: "You ripped your own eye out, opened the sealed box and dreadfully saw the Eye of Hazimel literally jump to your eye socket to implant itself. The sensation is confusing. It is not exactly pain as you are far above such petty concerns, but the sheer volume of images and memories that suddenly flood you is overwhelming. You see civilizations rise and fall and Cainites far older than you battling each other in unending wars... And all the while, the Eye spreads its tendrils in your inert body, trying to take over while you are distracted.\nYou realize it just quickly enough to have a chance of fighting back, but the Eye increases its attack on your mind tenfold when it sees that you haven't given up yet..."

 POD_canon_artifacts.302.desc: "You are stronger than a mere flesh relic, even one as vindictive as the Eye of Hazimel. Slowly, piece by piece, you fought back the corrupted influence in your mind and crawled back to consciousness. The Eye tried several other tricks, from nightmare fueled visions to base physical pain, but you stood strong.\nExhausted, or perhaps simply impressed by your resilience, the artifact has stopped fighting you back and now seems content on serving as your own eye. It is still a sentient being though, and you can feel the power within it very close to your grasp. A strange, but very profitable, partnership is born."

This shallow victory means that you still have some modicum of free will, but the Eye takes over when it feels like it. And it is always unpleasant for those around you when that happens.\nCertainly, you are more powerful and intimidating than you ever was but the price was high. The good thing is that you aren't in a state where you could ponder if it was worth it."

 POD_canon_artifacts.900.desc: "Some research has confirmed that the book you are holding in your hands contains the secret necromantic knowledge of the Iovanus family, most commonly known nowadays as the Giovanni. This codex was made by a rebel member of their line long before they became vampires and held by him ever since, mostly in an act of spite against the family that took everything from him.\nThis man, Aurelius Flavius Iovianus, bound the soul of his murdered wife, Titia Sabina, to the book in an effort to save her and also create powerful guardian for the codex. This effort paid off very well and you are convinced that you can't access the content of the book without Titia's approval.\nA direct conflict would be unwise as you gathered that Tinia has several [Fetters|E] in this world so she could easily destroy the book if you tried a hostile action against her. Shrewd diplomacy seems to be the only way forward."
