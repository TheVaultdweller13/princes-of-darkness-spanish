 POD_education_events.1.t: "An Education"
 POD_education_events.1.desc: "Your new childe has taken [victim.GetHerHis] first tentative steps into the night. Now experienced enough to understand how to feed, it will soon be time to begin a formal education, which will be very important for [victim.GetHerHis] future, but also for your relationship. What will your approach be?"
 POD_education_events.1.option.a: "Teach [victim.GetFirstName] [victim.GetHerHis] place"
 POD_education_events.1.option.b: "Keep [victim.GetHerHim] close, but with some liberties"
 POD_education_events.1.option.c: "[victim.GetFirstName] will figure it on [victim.GetHerHis] own"
 POD_education_events.1.option.obedience: "This education can provide obedient, if uninspired, childer"
 POD_education_events.1.option.lenient: "A balanced education"
 POD_education_events.1.option.free: "With this education, [victim.GetFirstName] is more likely to turn out good, but also more free spirited"
 POD_education_events.1.option.d: "Apply your masterful teaching skills"
 POD_education_events.1.option.durga: "As Durga Syn, you can ensure that your childe will turn great for [victim.GetHerHis] first steps with this unique option" 
 POD_education_events.2.t: "An Education: The Stick"
 POD_education_events.2.desc: "The youngsters nowadays... You have barely started teaching the fool that you hear complaints about the 'harsh' and 'unjust' way your are doing things. As if [victim.GetSheHe] would learn otherwise!\nAnyway, you can recognize the signs of your childe being close to break under your pressure if you don't relent. You could, obviously, change your approach, but 'changing' isn't something vampires easily do."
 POD_education_events.2.option.a: "The old methods work best"
 POD_education_events.2.option.b: "I will relent, for now"
 POD_education_events.3.t: "An Education: Human Ties"
 POD_education_events.3.desc: "Your childe still has human ties, friends, family and such. As for most young vampires, it is very difficult for [victim.GetHerHim] to let them go. Obviously, you know better, and these feelings are better kept under wraps, as [the_masquerade|E] is endangered by rash actions around mortals. And you often make rash actions with your loved ones.\nPerhaps it is time for your childe to learn to let go of the past?"
 POD_education_events.3.option.a: "I will cover up for [victim.GetFirstName]. let the youth have [victim.GetHerHis] dreams"
 POD_education_events.3.option.b: "Childe, we must talk..."
 POD_education_events.4.t: "An Education: Freedom!"
 POD_education_events.4.desc: "Lately, you haven't been able to take care of your childe much. You hoped that this newfound freedom would result in some interesting insights [victim.GetFirstName] could discover on [victim.GetHerHis] own but... not quite.\nStill resenting you for being turned into a vampire, this unruly neonate has started publicly doubting your authority, and not answering your rare summons. This could escalate quickly if you don't stop this behavior now."
 POD_education_events.4.option.a: "Childe, we need to talk..."
 POD_education_events.4.option.b: "It will pass, probably"
 POD_education_events.100.t: "An Education: Matters of Faith"
 POD_education_events.100.desc: "So far, your childe has followed your faith mostly because you said so. Obviously though, [victim.GetSheHe] is far from understanding the inner workings of the Beast and how to dealt with it. You will have to take some time to start this part of the teaching, or hire some learned practitioners of the Road to help your progeny along."
 POD_education_events.100.option.a: "The first thing to know..."
 POD_education_events.100.option.b: "Listen well to your teachers. They weren't cheap."
 POD_education_events.100.option.c: "I can tell you much more about our Road"
 POD_education_events.100.dionysius: "As Dionysius, you can use this option to make sure your childe will stay on your road and be taught well about it"
 POD_education_events.101.t: "An Education: Tempted by Humanity"
 POD_education_events.101.desc: "It's not a big surprise that, despite your teachings, your childe has been tempted by Via Humanitatis. It is, after all, the easiest road to follow for a neonate, and try to closely walk into the mortals' footsteps.\nYou are planning to stage a grand show of faith, by not interfering with humanity for the coming months, as a proof to your childe of the truth in the matter. Or you could just let it slide."
 POD_education_events.101.option.a: "We are grounded for the coming months"
 POD_education_events.101.option.b: "Youth will be youth"
 POD_education_events.102.t: "An Education: Tempted by Rebellion"
 POD_education_events.102.desc: "Disturbing reports as your spies have finally tracked the recent vanishing of your childe to a group of rebels in the fringes of your realm. These so called 'Furores' are a plague to any self respecting vampire, wanting to abolish the fine traditions of the blood in a vain attempt of 'freedom'.\nYour childe must be quickly shown the error of [victim.GetHerHis] ways, or [victim.GetSheHe] even might start to believe in these idiocies!"
 POD_education_events.102.option.a: "Go to your chamber and don't leave it until I say so!"
 POD_education_events.102.option.b: "It will pass, as all things do"
 POD_education_events.300.t: "An Education: The End"
 POD_education_events.300.desc: "You have done what you could. Your childe has learned the ways of your condition, the methods to use to control the Beast, and even how to approach the clans and their subtleties. Perhaps it will suffice. Or perhaps you have created the most dangerous foe you will ever face.\nTime will tell, at it always does."
 POD_education_events.300.option.a: "You are no longer a helpless fledgling. But you are still my childe."
 POD_education_events.5.t: "An Education: Easygoing Childe"
 POD_education_events.5.desc: "So far, your childe has taken well enough to [victim.GetHerHis] new condition. [victim.GetFirstName] doesn't make a fuss, [victim.GetSheHe] listens to your commands, and is all around a diligent student.\nIt might not last, but it's already better than most childer. So you enjoy it while you can."
 POD_education_events.5.option.a: "I'm pleased with you, childe"
 POD_education_events.5.option.b: "You will make a good impression at my court"
 POD_education_events.6.t: "An Education: Diplomat Childe"
 POD_education_events.6.desc: "Since [victim.GetHerHis] introduction to the night, [victim.GetFirstName] has shown a keen interest in court etiquette. Always trying to learn more about the clans and the various politics of your race, [victim.GetSheHe] is already a valuable asset in your diplomatic arsenal.\nYou know that fledglings are fickle though, and this interest might not last. As such, you are considering cashing in this as soon as possible."
 POD_education_events.6.option.a: "You are doing well so far, childe"
 POD_education_events.6.option.b: "You will accompany my diplomats for the coming weeks"
 POD_education_events.7.t: "An Education: Obedient Childe"
 POD_education_events.7.desc: "You have again proved your superior skills with this specific childe. The envy of every prospective [Sire|E], your progeny is obediently helping in every way [victim.GetSheHe] can, all the while giving thanks to the great patron that brought [victim.GetHerHim] to the night.\nYou could concentrate your next efforts on making [victim.GetHerHim] an useful ally long term, or simply a reliable assistant for now."
 POD_education_events.7.option.a: "Let us talk about the future, childe"
 POD_education_events.7.option.b: "Get back to work"
 POD_education_events.8.t: "An Education: Spirited Childe"
 POD_education_events.8.desc: "You new childe has taken to the night like a charm. With an avid curiosity, [victim.GetSheHe] has quickly learned on [victim.GetHerHis] own the basic knowledge needed to survive in the [cainite|E] world. You are appreciative, and also relieved that this doesn't seem to have given [victim.GetHerHim] ideas of independence... yet.\nThe next step is knowing if you will let [victim.GetHerHim] continue on this way, or try to work closer with [victim.GetHerHim] for your advantage."
 POD_education_events.8.option.a: "Ah, to be young again!"
 POD_education_events.8.option.b: "Let us work together, childe"
 POD_education_events.9.t: "An Education: Clumsy Childe"
 POD_education_events.9.desc: "You childe is doing well enough so far, except in one aspect: court etiquette. For some reason, [victim.GetSheHe] can't quite wrap up [victim.GetHerHis] head around the proper protocol to be observed in court. It's not that hard really! If you want to salvage this one diplomacy skills, you will have to teach [victim.GetHerHim] court politics by example. Which isn't the most glorious thing to do."
 POD_education_events.9.option.a: "Stay right here and watch. And don't say a thing."
 POD_education_events.9.option.b: "...Well, this one will have other use, I hope"
 POD_education_events.103.t: "An Education: Tempted by Gold"
 POD_education_events.103.desc: "Your new childe has proven to be quite quirky in [victim.GetHerHis] adaptation to vampirism. [victim.GetSheHe|U] thinks that [victim.GetHerHis] new condition is best used at... making money. [victim.GetSheHe|U] talks all day long about how immortality means easy investments, new opportunities and such nonsense.\nAs you sigh, you console yourself by thinking that it's at least a better hobby than trying to murder you. But you might still want to bring [victim.GetHerHim] out of this 'phase'."
 POD_education_events.103.option.a: "Here is your damn gold. Knock yourself out."
 POD_education_events.103.option.b: "...What will those damn fledglings think of next?"
 POD_education_events.104.t: "An Education: Faithful Childe"
 POD_education_events.104.desc: "Your childe has easily adopted your own tenets as [victim.GetHerHis] faith. You are pleased by the progress shown so far and expect nothing more than continued improvement. As a successful teacher, you also attained a deeper understanding thanks to this shared experience."
 POD_education_events.104.option.a: "As it should be"
 POD_education_events.105.t: "An Education: Tempted by Hedonism"
 POD_education_events.105.desc: "Your childe has taken well to [victim.GetHerHis] new condition. Perhaps a bit too well... [victim.GetFirstName] spends [victim.GetHerHis] time partying with mortals, or even other vampires, in a quite depraved fashion.\nObviously, you would prefer [victim.GetHerHim] doing useful things with [victim.GetHerHis] immortality, but convincing [victim.GetHerHim] might be an arduous task at this point."
 POD_education_events.105.option.a: "Put this mortal down childe, we have to talk"
 POD_education_events.105.option.b: "I don't even care at this point..."
 POD_education_events.10.t: "An Education: Steward Childe"
 POD_education_events.10.desc: "[victim.GetFirstName] has been enterprising since [victim.GetHerHis] [Embrace|E], [victim.GetSheHe] has outlined several projects to add outlier regions to your influence, and new people to bribe to make sure that it's stay hidden.\nYou are considering pushing the eager neonate further into this direction, or using [victim.GetHerHis] insight on such matters right now."
 POD_education_events.10.option.a: "You got a talent right here, childe"
 POD_education_events.10.option.b: "Interesting, tell me more about your plans"
 POD_education_events.11.t: "An Education: Clueless Childe"
 POD_education_events.11.desc: "Your progeny has a hard time understanding that, as a vampire, rules are different than they were in mortal life. [victim.GetHerHis|U] habits as a living being are hindering [victim.GetHerHim], and administrating the web of informants and agents seems way above [victim.GetHerHis] understanding right now.\nYou could organize a 'practice mission' to teach [victim.GetHerHim] the ropes, or just give up on this part of the training process."
 POD_education_events.11.option.a: "Follow me and observe, childe"
 POD_education_events.11.option.b: "The records books are off limits to you"
 POD_education_events.106.t: "An Education: Tempted by the Crown"
 POD_education_events.106.desc: "Your new progeny is fascinated by the power structure of the vampires, and [victim.GetSheHe] wants to know everything about who rules what, and how you achieved your current station as a ruler of the night.\nWhile flattering, this is quickly bringing [victim.GetHerHim] closer to the Via Regalis, something you might not approve of."
 POD_education_events.106.option.a: "Let us focus on the spiritual for a while, childe"
 POD_education_events.106.option.b: "Why yes I can talk about myself!"
 POD_education_events.12.t: "An Education: Schemer Childe"
 POD_education_events.12.desc: "Your new childe loves the cloak and dagger ambiance of vampire politics. [victim.GetSheHe|U] has already outwitted some other neonates, and shown a serious talent for intrigue. You could push [victim.GetHerHim] more towards honing these skills on [victim.GetHerHis] own, or you could use the help for some pressing schemes you are currently planning..."
 POD_education_events.12.option.a: "You are doing great childe. Just take to not do too great..."
 POD_education_events.12.option.b: "What do you think of these plans?"
 POD_education_events.13.t: "An Education: Outwitted Childe"
 POD_education_events.13.desc: "Your progeny has trouble adjusting to this new unlife. [victim.GetFirstName] takes most of what is said at face value, and doesn't consider that, well, everybody lies in vampire politics. Your best efforts to teach [victim.GetHerHim] have been, so far, fruitless. And it is starting to get on your nerves."
 POD_education_events.13.option.a: "These people aren't your friends. We don't have friends."
 POD_education_events.13.option.b: "Well, this one won't be threatening to me at least"
 POD_education_events.107.t: "An Education: Tempted by the Gloved Fist"
 POD_education_events.107.desc: "Your childe has shown a serious interest into matters of rulership. An interest that has made [victim.GetHerHim], so far, conclude that might makes right. While you don't necessarily agree, you must admit that you have already picked up some interesting insights by [victim.GetHerHis] way of doing things. Perhaps encouraging [victim.GetHerHim] to continue would yield further experience?"
 POD_education_events.107.option.a: "There is more to power than raw strength, childe"
 POD_education_events.107.option.b: "Perhaps we can learn of each other, after all"
 POD_education_events.14.t: "An Education: Friendly Childe"
 POD_education_events.14.desc: "Your progeny has adapted quite well to the unlife so far. You must admit that you feel an even stronger connection with [victim.GetHerHim] that you anticipated before the [Embrace|E]. Perhaps this time, for once, your long nights of loneliness will be filled with newfound companionship."
 POD_education_events.14.option.a: "Let us talk some more, childe"
 POD_education_events.108.t: "An Education: Tempted by the Heavens"
 POD_education_events.108.desc: "Your childe always needed something to believe in during [victim.GetHerHis] mortal days. As such, you aren't overly surprised that [victim.GetSheHe] lashed on the Via Caeli as [victim.GetHerHis] road of predilection. What you weren't expecting though, is the sheer fervor [victim.GetSheHe] shown so far. You aren't moved by many things nowadays, but perhaps a pure show of devotion can be one of those few things?"
 POD_education_events.108.option.a: "I am what I am"
 POD_education_events.108.option.b: "You are an inspiring sight, childe"
 POD_education_events.15.t: "An Education: Martial Childe"
 POD_education_events.15.desc: "Vampire wars are very different than mortal ones. A matter of relative secrecy, using a few number of elite troops, these wars require a flexible skillset. Luckily, your childe seems to have a natural understanding of the challenges that such a warfare style brings to the table.\nHow will you encourage [victim.GetHerHim] to use these initial successes?"
 POD_education_events.15.option.a: "Continue on your own, childe"
 POD_education_events.15.option.b: "You should focus your expertise on one area, childe"
 POD_education_events.16.t: "An Education: Toothless Childe"
 POD_education_events.16.desc: "Of all things, it seems to be with the scale of vampire conflict that your childe is having trouble with. Obviously very different than mortal warfare, with their small number of elite troops, these battles can be difficult to assess for an unprepared commander. You could forget the issue, as not all vampires are destined to see a battlefield anyway, or organize a 'live example' with some local mortal troops to make your childe learn a thing or two."
 POD_education_events.16.option.a: "Concentrate on your other studies, childe"
 POD_education_events.16.option.b: "Let us play a wargame with mortals, childe"
 POD_education_events.17.t: "An Education: Unspectacular Childe"
 POD_education_events.17.desc: "So far, your new progeny has been doing good enough. Nothing spectacular though, which has made you think that [victim.GetSheHe] could be useful in other ways. Maybe as an example? Most $pod_cainites$ give great show of their progeny's brilliance, but you could reverse this habit. Crush your childe's mind, for no reason than sheer cruelty, and you would be feared for quite a while after..."
 POD_education_events.17.option.a: "It won't hurt... long"
 POD_education_events.17.option.b: "This one can still be useful"
 POD_education_events.109.t: "An Education: Tempted by Cruelty"
 POD_education_events.109.desc: "Your childe seems to have embraced [victim.GetHerHis] new condition as a monster of the night a little too eagerly. You have heard tales of disturbing 'parties' and 'experiments' that [victim.GetSheHe] has been a part of, or even organized. Sadly, the little wretch will probably not accept easily your authority on this matter..."
 POD_education_events.109.option.a: "You will stop this craziness at once!"
 POD_education_events.109.option.b: "As long as it doesn't impact me..."
 POD_education_events.18.t: "An Education: Studious Childe"
 POD_education_events.18.desc: "Your childe is fascinated by the vast history of the [cainite|E] race. The clans, the myths, the rumors... everything [victim.GetSheHe] can learn about really. [victim.GetSheHe|U] might actually have insight into some matters you didn't thought about for long while now. Perhaps you could work together?"
 POD_education_events.18.option.a: "You have my blessing to continue, childe"
 POD_education_events.18.option.b: "What do you think of this story, childe?"
 POD_education_events.19.t: "An Education: Slow Childe"
 POD_education_events.19.desc: "Your progeny has trouble with the vast amount of new information [victim.GetSheHe] has to learn. The clans, the history of the [cainite|E] race, the myths... it seems to be too much. If you don't do something soon, your childe will probably give up, which might be a hindrance for [victim.GetHerHis] initiation into the night."
 POD_education_events.19.option.a: "...This one will serve another purpose"
 POD_education_events.19.option.b: "Let us take some time to study together, childe"
 POD_education_events.20.t: "An Education: Perfect Teacher"
 POD_education_events.20.desc: "As the most respected elder of the Western Ravnos, you have taught many youngsters in your time, Durga Syn. You even actually enjoy doing it, appearing from nowhere to bring confused neonates your, often cryptic, wisdom.\nAs such, it is easy enough applying your great talents to your own progeny. A gentle poke here, a subtle push there and this one will turn exactly as you want."
 POD_education_events.20.option.a: "Listen to your Beast, then wrestle it down"
 POD_education_events.20.option.b: "Rose is for the Roses, Blue is for the Lords" 
 POD_education_events.20.option.c: "To unlock your own mystery, you must seek your own key"
 POD_education_events.110.t: "An Education: Lack of Ambition"
 POD_education_events.110.desc: "As of late, your childe is approaching [victim.GetHerHis] unlife in a more careful manner than before. Satisfied by staying in the shadows, [victim.GetSheHe] appears content on letting responsibilities and dangers to others, even still [victim.GetSheHe] often provides [victim.GetHerHis] expertise when needed. Although reassuring for you to have a seemingly trustworthy childe, you might have other plans for the future."
 POD_education_events.110.option.a: "Grow a spine, childe!"
 POD_education_events.110.option.b: "One less potential rival... probably"
 POD_education_events.111.t: "An Education: Perfect Teacher"
 POD_education_events.111.desc: "Few $pod_cainites$ can claim having shaped a road like you did with the Road of Humanity, lord Dionysius. It obviously gave you a keen insight on these matters, and you have been learning and debating about those for quite a long time.\nAs such, there is very few people more qualified in teaching about this than you. The fledgling in your care right now is very privileged indeed."
 POD_education_events.111.option.a: "I will learn a lot by debating with a fresh mind"
 POD_education_events.111.option.b: "I have much to teach you"
 POD_education_events.200.t: "An Education: The Presentation"
 POD_education_events.200.desc: "It is time for your childe to be formally presented to your court... or is it? This traditional part of [cainite|E] society is fraught with both opportunities and dangers as your [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetFollowerOrVassalPlural')] will certainly look for any weakness worth exploiting in your new protege.\nYou could skip the whole affair, but this won't reflect well on you."
 POD_education_events.200.option.a: "Behave yourself in there"
 POD_education_events.200.option.b: "No need for them to know about you"
 POD_education_events.201.t: "An Education: Annoying [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetFollowerOrVassal')|U]"
 POD_education_events.201.desc: "During your childe's presentation, one of your [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetFollowerOrVassalPlural')] took every opportunity available to nag on your progeny. Not good enough, not worthy of the [Embrace|E], waste of time... You can see that your childe is barely keeping [victim.GetHerHis] temper in check at this point.\nYou might want to intervene if you don't want these two to hate each other."
 POD_education_events.201.option.a: "As long as they don't hate me..."
 POD_education_events.201.option.b: "Just stop talking"
 POD_education_events.202.t: "An Education: Friendly [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetFollowerOrVassal')|U]"
 POD_education_events.202.desc: "One of your [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetFollowerOrVassalPlural')] really took a liking in your childe during the presentation. Genuine or politically minded, it doesn't really matter as long as it keeps the peace here. You join them as they are talking heartily to each other."
 POD_education_events.202.option.a: "I am glad you are getting along"
 POD_education_events.202.option.b: "Why yes! I choose my childe very well!"
 POD_education_events.203.t: "An Education: Scheming [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetFollowerOrVassal')|U]"
 POD_education_events.203.desc: "Your childe made a small mistake during the presentation. Surprisingly, one of your [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetFollowerOrVassalPlural')] helped cover it up quickly enough to not have repercussions.\nYou understand why when this scheming snake comes to you, telling you that you owe [victim.GetHerHim] now..."
 POD_education_events.203.option.a: "You won this round"
 POD_education_events.203.option.b: "I owe you nothing!"
 POD_education_events.204.t: "An Education: Infatuated [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetFollowerOrVassal')|U]"
 POD_education_events.204.desc: "One of your [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetFollowerOrVassalPlural')] has been smitten by your childe's flawless presentation and is now asking for some private time with your progeny. Obviously, it would be an easy way for you to get [victim.GetHerHim] in your debt, but your progeny might not appreciate be used as some sort of gift."
 POD_education_events.204.option.a: "Come here childe, I want to introduce you to someone..."
 POD_education_events.204.option.b: "Sadly, I can't accept your demand"
 POD_education_events.205.t: "An Education: Good Enough"
 POD_education_events.205.desc: "Your childe's presentation went... well enough. Not a smashing success by any means, but not a blunder either. You suppose that, in vampiric society, even achieving an average success is already quite hard anyway."
 POD_education_events.205.option.a: "Distinctly average"
 POD_education_events.206.t: "An Education: Flawless"
 POD_education_events.206.desc: "Everything about your childe's presentation went very well, even above your expectations. Your [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetFollowerOrVassalPlural')] were impressed by your new progeny, and even more impressed by your qualities as a [Sire|E]. This will reflect well on you for some time."
 POD_education_events.206.option.a: "A perfect outcome"
 POD_education_events.207.t: "An Education: Shrouded Failure"
 POD_education_events.207.desc: "On the surface, everything appears to have gone well for your childe's presentation. But deep down, you know that something went wrong. Your [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetFollowerOrVassalPlural')] were all honeyed words, and congregated around one another, talking in hushed tones.\nPerhaps they planned this move for some time, or perhaps you did something to upset them. Whatever the reason, this might be an issue in the future."
 POD_education_events.207.option.a: "Politics never stop"
 POD_education_events.208.t: "An Education: Too Successful"
 POD_education_events.208.desc: "Your childe has made a great first impression during [victim.GetHerHis] presentation. Perhaps a little too great actually... Encouraged by your [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetFollowerOrVassalPlural')], eager to throw a wrench in your plans, [victim.GetSheHe] has started to have delusions of grandeur.\nObviously, this is way above [victim.GetHerHis] station or power right now, but the impudent whelp is almost openly plotting for [victim.GetHerHis] 'future' tenure as your heir. You will have to rein this one carefully..."
 POD_education_events.208.option.a: "Insolent idiot!"
 POD_education_events.209.t: "An Education: Impressed [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetFollowerOrVassal')|U]"
 POD_education_events.209.desc: "The presentation of your childe to the court is going well. Nothing really out of the ordinary, except the apparently genuine goodwill [victim.GetSheHe] earned from one of your powerful [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetFollowerOrVassalPlural')]. This small show of diplomacy can be leveraged to your advantage, either towards the [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetFollowerOrVassal')] or your childe."
 POD_education_events.209.option.a: "Obviously, my childe is speaking with my blessing"
 POD_education_events.209.option.b: "I choose you well, childe"
 POD_education_events.210.t: "An Education: The Gift"
 POD_education_events.210.desc: "During your childe's first introduction to the court, a small number of your [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetFollowerOrVassalPlural')] arrive with a generous gift... for your progeny, not for you. They are obviously trying to create a rift between you two by making you claim the gift for yourself. A not so subtle plot, but still enticing by its sheer value..."
 POD_education_events.210.option.a: "You are too young childe, this is mine"
 POD_education_events.210.option.b: "Enjoy yourself then"
 POD_education_events.211.t: "An Education: Gifted Childe"
 POD_education_events.211.desc: "You must admit, your childe is pretty good at smoothing your [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetFollowerOrVassalPlural')]' petty grievances and stroking their even pettier egos. Good enough actually that you don't need to anything during this introduction to the court.\nIt might be early, but you are wondering if you could use you gifted progeny to ease your burden of rulership, at least for a while."
 POD_education_events.211.option.a: "Let us talk about new responsibilities, childe"
 POD_education_events.211.option.b: "I will rest when I'm... well"
