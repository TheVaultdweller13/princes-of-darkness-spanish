In the past, their efforts to convince their fellow tribes to sit and talk about their feuds (instead of bashing each other's heads) haven't borne fruit.\nThis has changed recently however since they have proved the strength of their conviction and the great results that can be achieved if all the champions of Gaia acted as one.

But times have changed.\nWith the rampant growth of civilization and the leeches that control it, the Get of Fenris are advocating for the unity of the Garou Nation under their leadership as undisputed Alphas.

As the other tribes gave up on the idea, they found themselves more and more isolated. But the Red Talons are nothing if not patient.\nRetreating to the still wild steppes, they made sure to purge the area of any unwanted outsiders and bode their time. As the other tribes fall prey to humanity's growth and the vampires coming with it, the Red Talons prosper. And now, they are the strongest force remaining in the Garou Nation and their howls will be heard.\nThe Impergium will go as planned and Gaia will be saved in the blood of humanity, whether they like or not."
