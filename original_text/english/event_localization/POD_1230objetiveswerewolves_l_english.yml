The rise of Rome and the growth of cities that accompanied it marked the end of their dominance over the region and helped the vampires reduce the Furies' influence little by little. No more.\nThanks to a succession of powerful Matriarchs, the cunning use of mortal institutions against the vampires and some daring assaults worthy of the Amazons, the Black Furies have once again solidified a solid foothold in Italy.\nThe other tribes are watching now, wondering if the Furies can capitalize on this surprising victory. Maybe Gaia truly intend for her champions to be united under her daughters after all?"

Helped by the growth of human civilization, the sons of Rat did what they do best: survive, adapt and thrive.\nWhile the other tribes look more and more like relics of the past, the Bone Gnawers are more at home with this changed humanity than ever and everyone is now, begrudgingly, looking to them for help and advice on how to deal with this changed society.

In the past, their efforts to convince their fellow tribes to sit and talk about their feuds (instead of bashing each other's heads) haven't borne fruit.\nThis has changed recently however since they have proved the strength of their conviction and the great results that can be achieved if all the champions of Gaia acted as one. Finally, perhaps for the first time, the tribes are listening and the Garou Nation has never seemed so strong and united.\nTruly, Gaia must be smiling on her children right now."

This lack of discipline has seen them suffering major setbacks in the Isles, leading them to be more and more isolated from the rest of the Garou Nation.\nNo more however, as a strong succession of rulers and a renewed sense of purpose have seen the Fianna once again ascend as the masters of Britannia.

But their violent, bordering on abusive, ways makes them at odds with the rest of the tribes. But times have changed.\nWith the rampant growth of civilization and the leeches that control it, the Get of Fenris are advocating for the unity of the Garou Nation under their leadership as undisputed Alphas. With the successful recovery of their Swedish homeland, they make a strong case for themselves and many are flocking to their banners already.\nBlood and violence will tear down the foes of Gaia, and if that's not enough, even more bloodshed should do the trick..."

As the other tribes gave up on the idea, they found themselves more and more isolated. But the Red Talons are nothing if not patient.\nRetreating to the still wild steppes, they made sure to purge the area of any unwanted outsiders and bode their time. As the other tribes fall prey to humanity's growth and the vampires coming with it, the Red Talons prosper. And now, they are the strongest force remaining in the Garou Nation and their howls will be heard.\nThe Impergium will go as planned and Gaia will be saved in the blood of humanity, whether they like or not."

Tribes like the Shadow Lords or the Red Talons have sprung into the vacuum of power to chip away the Silver Fangs' authority and others like the Silent Striders or the Fianna have simply been lost due to geographical distance.\nWith their recent success in Russia however, the Silver Fangs are proving that they have only moved their seat of power and not lost the capabilities that made them so respected in the first place.

 pod1230objectives_werewolves.31.desc: "According to their legends, the Bagheera were once created as the judges of catkind. While this role has long since been abandoned, they have retained the natural curiosity and friendly charisma that came with it. As they often say, they are the truest embodiment of the cat spirit, wisdom, love and anger all fused together. Uniquely among the fractured Bastet tribes, the Bagheera managed to keep a cordial relationship with all of their cousins and, with their recent rise in fame, this has birthed the idea that maybe it is time for the werepanthers to leverage this strength and push for the unification of the divided Bastet Nation.\nWhile the other tribes are skeptical at best, the current talented leadership of the Bagheera has managed to at least bring them to the negotiation table. It now remains to be seen if the charismatic panthers will see this endeavor through to a satisfying conclusion."

 pod1230objectives_werewolves.32.desc: "Once revered as gods by the people of Egypt, the Bubasti lost everything in their war against the followers of Set. They have been patient however and their millennia of knowledge of the magical arts allowed them to watch and wait for the right moment to strike back.\nAnd they found it.\nLeading a daring combined force of the Osirian League in the Setite temple of Ombos, the Bubasti managed to rescue their lost kin, the Kyphur cats, and deal a powerful blow to their eternal foes.\nWith their pride restored and their feline kin finally allowed to prosper again, the midnight cats of Khem have made quite the impression on the rest of the Bastet Nation. While many are still wary of their strange sorcery, most are at least willing to entertain the idea of letting the Bubasti take on a more prominent role in the future."

 ceilican_objective_decision_desc: "Once carefree and living a life of hedonism, the Ceilican have been betrayed by the Faerie lord Samhach who hunted them so efficiently that they were almost driven to extinction. Freeing these captives would take a solid plan and an even more solid group of heroes but it might be the only hope for survival for the Ceilican tribe."

The "mercurial cats" weren't ready to give up however and, under your diligent leadership, managed to stage a surprising comeback, storming Lord Samhach's Faerie court and liberating their captive brethren.\nAs the victorious Ceilican dance and feast in the ruins of the hated betrayer's court, the rest of the Bastet Nation takes notice of this puzzling development. Once thought extinct, it seems it will be now time to welcome the Ceilican back among their cat brethren, perhaps a sign of Mother Seline's will for her children to finally go past their personal grudges and unite under one banner?"

 pod1230objectives_werewolves.34.desc: "The wrathful Simba think that the Bastet should be led by a lion, a lazy creature relying on his wives to hunt and on his strength to bully others into submission. The Khan show the example of the tiger instead, a wise and graceful predator that does the fighting itself when needed but otherwise seeks to improve its and its pack's condition. For a long while, the other Bastet have secretly hoped that the Khan would take on a more prominent role in the Bastet Nation to counteract the Simba.\nThanks to your steady leadership and the recovery of the legendary Judgment Hammer, this time has now come. The Simba might posture and growl as they wish but the other tribes are now rallying behind the tigers' call for unity."

 pod1230objectives_werewolves.35.desc: "Simba legends claim that each Bastet tribe was created by Mother Seline with a purpose in mind. Theirs was to be the lord. Obviously, the other Bastet tend to heavily disagree on that interpretation. Their petty whimpering is however of no concern to the mighty lions.\nAs the other tribes lose themselves in useless small-minded concerns, the Simba do the only thing worth doing: they conquer and affirm their right to rule Africa and beyond as the true kings of this land. And with their recent successes in backing that claim, the other tribes stand silent for once."

Many dismiss them as cowards, always running apparently aimlessly from place to place and avoiding conflict. This couldn't be farther from the truth. The Swara are diligent defenders of the purity of the land and they fight as hard as any lion when their sacred duty is threatened.\nWhile they haven't been clamoring it, their work has started to gain recognition among the Bastet Nation as of late. The other tribes stand silent, contemplating that they were bickering or obsessing over small concerns while the Swara were doing Mother Seline's bidding. This had lead to a surprising impetus putting them at the forefront of the renewed call for Bastet unity. It remains to be seen if the usually isolationist "Silver Folk" will be heeding that call in the future."

 pod1230objectives_werewolves.37.desc: "With your recent success putting your tribe at the forefront of the Bastet, the idea of consolidating the scattered tribes into a cohesive whole has resurfaced once again. Most legends of catkind agree that you were once intended by Mother Seline to work alongside each other and that the division that happened in the earliest days was the main cause of your defeat against the werewolves during the War of Rage.\nStill, despite this agreed upon fact, it will be a very difficult task bringing catkind together once again. Each tribe will need to be convinced and cats are nothing if not both stubborn and fickle creatures at the same time."

 pod1230objectives_werewolves.38.desc: "The Bagheera are fully on board with your plan to restore the Bastet Nation. After all they have been advocating for doing just that for centuries. Still, the judges of catkind do not want a repeat of the errors of the past and they want to be certain that you are fit to lead your brethren into a prosperous future.\nThey intend to observe how you work and how you surround yourself as a ruler before giving their full commitment to the cause. To help in this matter, they have offered the teachings of one of their wisest mentors to work on your weaknesses while improving your strengths."

They are keen on accepting you as the ruler of catkind... if you pledge your considerable resources to their help.

Hearing of the renewed effort to unify the Bastet, they have come to humbly request your assistance in liberating their remaining survivors from their nemesis' grasp.\nAs the prospective ruler of all the Children of Seline, you would be hard pressed to refuse such a plea for help."

The Khan have however issued you a challenge to prove that you are indeed the chosen of Seline that you claim to be. They even offered to put you through their traditional trial for Khan nobility, a well known ruthless and difficult exercise.

You expected your proposal of uniting catkind under your leadership to go quite badly with them.\nSomehow, it went even worse.\nIt took a lot of effort to subdue the Simba delegates and stop them from just jumping at you claws first to "punish you for your impudence". They are still screaming bloody murder as they are dragged out of the room and you are left to consider your next move. It's becoming clear that the lions will only be subdued if you prove your might on their own territory: Africa."

The werecheetah don't intent to get in your way or contest your claim but they remind you of the sacred duty of the Children of Seline, protecting the pure lands. If you can prove your commitment to this ancestral duty, they will fully join the fold. Otherwise they will continue to do their own thing far from the intrigues of the rest of catkind, as they always did so far.\nJudging by some structural weaknesses you noticed in this specific den-realm, you think you could make a donation to help them improve their defenses here, showing that you are indeed taking their request very seriously."
