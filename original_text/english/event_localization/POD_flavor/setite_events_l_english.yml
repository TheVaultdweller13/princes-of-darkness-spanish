 podsetite.1.t: "The Clan of Faith"
 podsetite.1.desc: "The Followers of Set are as much a religion as they are a proper [Clan|E]. They see every vampire worshiping Set as part of their community, although those directly descended from him are still the most favored.\nThe Setites have perfected the art of infiltrating and corrupting (or "liberating") other religions and cults, slowly unveiling the mysteries of Set to them before fully bringing them into the fold. This is by far their greatest weapon, and many would be conquerors of Egypt found themselves welcomed, then enthralled into the cult instead of directly resisting them.\nIn this age of Crusades and religious fervor, the Setites are looking abroad at all these poor souls despairing for their heretical gods' approval. And they see opportunities aplenty."
 podsetite.1.a: "Welcome to the Serpent's Garden."
 setite_intro_tt: "As long as you stay of a Setite faith, you have access to a decision to syncretize any religion you control three or more holy sites with the Cult of Set."
 
 podsetite.2.t: "The Serpent's Embrace"
 podsetite.2.desc: "It starts slowly. The hint of a deep mystery teased to some important figures of the targeted faith, the fostering of decadence and self gratification, the slow spread of more "liberating" ideas to the practitioners.\nThen it cascades. The revelation that all mysteries (including their own) lead to Set. The acceptance that the world is a prison built by Ra and his Aeons, and everything they though true was a lie. Then, finally, the zeal of the new convert, eager to show the truth to their fellow brethren.\nAnd before you know it, this whole faith is now only an useful facade for Set's cult. As all should be, until the grand night of liberation."
