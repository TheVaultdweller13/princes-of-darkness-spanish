 podcappadocian.1.t:0 "Daughters of Lilith"
 podcappadocian.1.desc:0 "The mysterious Lamia bloodline is tied to clan Cappadocian on their own accord. The daughters of Lilith are a difficult to understand lot but they have always proved reliable and steadfast in upholding the end of the bargain they made a long time ago with Cappadocius : serving as bodyguards to eminent Cappadocians.\nThe time has come for you to request one such companion. The usual procedure would simply be for you to ask a Lamian priestess, which would result in one of their younger members being assigned to you. A more involved course of action would be to insist on having some input on the process which might annoy the Lamian, but would also give you more control over who would be this potentially lifelong companion."
 podcappadocian.1.a:0 "Priestess, I trust your choice."
 podcappadocian.1.b:0 "I want to learn more the daughters of Lilith before choosing."
 lamia_bodyguard_generic_tt:0 "A young Lamia will be presented to you, likely to be skilled in battle but unexceptional otherwise."
 lamia_bodyguard_specialized_tt:0 "You will have more choice and potentially better candidates proposed, for a prestige cost."
 
 podcappadocian.2.t:0 "The Youngest Sister"
 podcappadocian.2.desc:0 "The temple of Lamia has acknowledged your request for a bodyguard and the chosen one has recently arrived to start her work at your service. No real surprises there, it is indeed a quite young member of the Lamia that has been sent, one that has been taught enough swordplay to be useful, but not much else. Still, the loyalty and drive of these young Lamian are legendary and she has plenty of time left to grow.\nUntil then, she is waiting for your commands."
 podcappadocian.2.a:0 "The start of a fruitful relationship."
   
 podcappadocian.3.t:0 "Mysteries of Lilith"
 podcappadocian.3.desc:0 "Despite their close association with clan Cappadocian, the Lamia aren't exactly fond of you snooping around their temple and cult practices. Still, they have begrudgingly accepted to teach you about the three faces of Lilith : the Maid, the Mother and the Crone. Each of those represents a different part of a woman's life and is celebrated accordingly. Your guide refuses to tell you more and the Lamia urges you to quickly choose a companion then leave them to their rituals.\nFrom what you have gathered, priestesses of the Maid are likely to be young and beautiful, skilled at diplomacy. Priestesses of the Mother are matronly administrators, handling the day to day of the cults. Finally, priestesses of the Crone are old witches, guardians of Lilith's sacred rituals."
 podcappadocian.3.a:0 "A priestess of the Maid."
 podcappadocian.3.b:0 "A priestess of the Mother."
 podcappadocian.3.c:0 "A priestess of the Crone."

 podcappadocian.4.t:0 "The Younger Sister"
 podcappadocian.4.desc:0 "You choose a priestess of the Maid to accompany you. A beautiful, often bordering on seductive, creature, she seems content enough to be stuck with you for the foreseeable future. She is easy to talk to, but will quickly make sure every conversation ends up with her praising the great pleasures that can be had if one was to completely give themselves to Lilith.\nShe is simple, unaltered, freedom and beauty, the innocence of young maiden channeled through her every move. To be young again, at least in spirit, is always a tempting prospect..."
 podcappadocian.4.a:0 "Let us not talk of religion again."
 podcappadocian.4.b:0 "I feel swayed..."
 
 podcappadocian.5.t:0 "The Middle Sister"
 podcappadocian.5.desc:0 "You choose a priestess of the Mother to accompany you. Strong and dedicated women, servants of the Mother are prone to take over the duties and burden of those around them, often to their own expense. They are the representatives of Lilith's divine creative essence, often misinterpreted as "Mother of Monsters" in myths. Servants of the Mother take their responsibilities with the utmost care and are very rarely seen not being deeply busy canalizing the Maids and caring for the Crones."

 podcappadocian.6.t:0 "The Older Sister"
 podcappadocian.6.desc:0 "You choose a priestess of the Crone to accompany you. The most feared members of the cult of Lilith, the Crone are the depository of Lilith's forbidden knowledge. No one truly knows the extent of Lilim lore, but even the most stubborn Noddist will agree that Lilith's part in the Genesis is the most mysterious and frightening account of those events.\nThe Crones don't talk, but they enjoy proving that they know the truth, whatever it could be, and their unnerving smile promise so much more knowledge for those ready to pledge themselves to the Dark Mother."
