 pod_lasombraevents.1.n: "Seeing Faces"
 pod_lasombraevents.1.desc: "Faces. The last week you have been acutely aware of them. Be it mortals, vampires or a bunch of rocks arranged just right, everything has a face. Including you, of course. Except that, like all of our [Clan|E], you are cursed to never see your face or your body again. How long has it been since you last saw your own reflection? Have you ever seen it, anyway? You were a mortal so long ago... How do other people react when they see you for the first time? Are they scared, or entranced, or do they laugh behind your back?\nThese questions are having way too much effect on you and it is time to do something about it. The most straightforward way is to hire an artist and have them draw your portrait. At the very least, it may ease the pain."
 pod_lasombraevents.1.loverdesc: "Faces. The last few days you have been acutely aware of them. Be it mortals, vampires or a bunch of rocks arranged just right, everything has a face. Including you, of course. Except that, like all of our [Clan|E], you are cursed to never see your face or your body again. How long has it been since you last saw your own reflection? Have you ever seen it, anyway? You were a mortal so long ago... How do other people react when they see you for the first time? Are they scared, or entranced, or do they laugh behind your back?\nThese questions are having way too much effect on you and it is time to do something about it. The most straightforward way is to hire an artist and have them draw your portrait. You could also ask you lover, [helper.GetTitledFirstName], to give a nice description of you, who knows?"
 pod_lasombraevents.1.a: "I need a portrait..."
 pod_lasombraevents.1.b: "I have no need for it."
 pod_lasombraevents.1.c: "Pff! I don't need this!"
 pod_lasombraevents.1.d: "I will ask for help."
 pod_lasombraevents.1.a.t: "You hire an artist to make your portrait."
 pod_lasombraevents.1.b.t: "You have more urgent things to spend money on."
 pod_lasombraevents.1.b.beast: "#beast You don't need anything. You have me.#!"
 pod_lasombraevents.1.c.t: "You always look good."
 pod_lasombraevents.1.d.t: "And help you receive."
 
 POD_courts_blood_interaction: "Petition for Sanctioned Diablerie"
 POD_courts_blood_interaction_desc: "Petition the Courts of Blood, presenting a case about why this character should be removed from the Lasombra's protection and hunted down for their very soul."
 courts_blood_tooltip: "If you win your case, this character won't cost piety to diablerize anymore. If you don't, you probably made a rival for unlife."
 
 POD_asdiqa_al_lail_interaction: "Petition for Sanctioned Diablerie"
 POD_asdiqa_al_lail_interaction_desc: "Petition the Asdiqa al-Lail, presenting a case about why this character should be removed from the Lasombra's protection and hunted down for their very soul."
  
 POD_amis_noirs_interaction: "Petition for Sanctioned Diablerie"

 pod_lasombraevents.2.n: "A New Case?"
 pod_lasombraevents.2.desc: "The Courts of Blood are the judiciary body of [Clan|E] Lasombra. These Elders, that stay anonymous, can be petitioned to pass judgment on various issues related to the clan as a whole. These Elders' time is precious though, so the Courts of Blood most often convene only for the gravest of cases: sanctioned [diablerie|E].\nClan Lasombra values the lust for power above all else, and takes great pride into making sure that each of its scions is worthy. As such, any Lasombra can petition the Courts to plead that another Lasombra is unworthy of even being alive, and that their blood would be best served empowering another one.\nIt is no surprise that such cases are often the start of legendary rivalries, and are always hotly debated."
 pod_lasombraevents.2.a: "Proceed with the case."
 pod_lasombraevents.2.b: "On second thought..."

 pod_lasombraevents.3.n: "Opening Session"
 pod_lasombraevents.3.desc: "A session of the Courts of Blood is a strange affair. Shrouded in darkness, the judges aren't visible and their voices are masked as well, giving the whole thing a very surreal feel. Still, the stakes are much higher than the theatrics would have you think.\nYou and the defender have been summoned to the Court and it is now time for both of you to convince the Elders of your respective worth. You know that, when all is said and done, the Courts don't really care about the truth of the matter. They simply want to ensure that Lasombra's blood is only given to the worthy so the end goal of this process is to prove that you are a more ambitious, ruthless and deserving individual than your opponent."
 pod_lasombraevents.3.a: "Esteemed judges..."
 pod_lasombraevents.3.effect.success.desc: "You are convincing."
 pod_lasombraevents.3.critical.failure.effect.desc: "You didn't convince."
 
 pod_lasombraevents.4.n: "Greasing the Wheels"
 pod_lasombraevents.4.desc: "While the judges of the Court of Blood stay anonymous, the Amici Noctis, the organization of Elders ruling over clan Lasombra, isn't. It is relatively easy to find one of their representative in each major city, if only to start an official petition.\nThese intermediaries are rarely paragons of virtue and can easily be bribed to make sure some evidence suddenly appear before the judges (or never do in some instances). This is an open secret really, and crafty Lasombra are expected to have the means to conduct such "business". After all, wealth is one way to measure your worth."
 pod_lasombraevents.4.a: "A sensible donation."
 pod_lasombraevents.4.b: "I don't need that to win."
 won_round_court_blood_tt: "The Courts of Blood's case progresses in your favor."
 
 pod_lasombraevents.5.n: "Street Justice"
 pod_lasombraevents.5.desc: "All is fair in war and justice in [Clan|E] Lasombra. You are trying to end the unlife of a fellow Lasombra and they are trying every trick possible to survive and sway the Court in their favor. Hiring a bunch of local thugs to rough you up between recesses of the Court is their last ditch effort.\nThis is a desperate attempt and you aren't in real danger. But the ease with which you will be able to dispatch those pests will reflect on the overall judgment. After all, Lasombra are supposed to be way above such petty concerns and easily able to show their superiority over mortals."
 pod_lasombraevents.5.a: "You targeted the wrong Lasombra."
 pod_lasombraevents.5.effect.success.desc: "Perfect!"
 pod_lasombraevents.5.critical.failure.effect.desc: "Pyrrhic Victory."
  
 pod_lasombraevents.6.n: "Show of Piety"
 pod_lasombraevents.6.desc: "Clan Lasombra values conviction. In many ways, they are a clan of faith, lashing on to any new mortal innovations in this field to create their own twisted take on them. At the end of the night, it doesn't matter what kind of faith you follow, as long as you make a sufficient show of doing it convincingly.\nTo sway the judges and prove that you are a worthy scion of the Lasombra, a show of piety might be a good choice."
 pod_lasombraevents.6.a: "I can make miracles happen."
  
 pod_lasombraevents.7.n: "Showing Strength"
 pod_lasombraevents.7.desc: "Lasombra are social climbers to an extreme. Their clan culture forces their members to always try to outdo each other in each and every possible field. Often, it leads to only the most ruthless and competent Lasombra being capable of leading but sometimes, it results in pompous fools with a lot of clout being elevated way beyond their skill.\nDuring this Court session, it might be worthwhile for you to engage in some politicking, flaunting your accomplishments and downplaying those of your opponent."
 pod_lasombraevents.7.a: "Did you know that I..."
   
 pod_lasombraevents.8.n: "Just the Two of Us"
 pod_lasombraevents.8.desc: "Your opponent during this Court of Blood session has taken an aggressive stance. Instead of trying to defend themselves against your accusations, they are attacking your accomplishments and slandering your undoubtedly flawless character. This is a quite valid strategy, as the Elders of the Court are valuing the Clan's strength above all and if you are convinced of being of lesser stature than your victim, most of your case will fall apart.\nIt is time for you to answer to these accusations and turn back the judges in your favor."
 pod_lasombraevents.8.a: "I have no weakness!"
 pod_lasombraevents.8.effect.success.desc: "I'm truly great."
 pod_lasombraevents.8.critical.failure.effect.desc: "I made some mistakes."
  
 pod_lasombraevents.10.n: "Objected!"
 pod_lasombraevents.10.desc: "The Court of Blood has given his final verdict and it's not a good one for you. Your opponent has been found to be a worthy Lasombra and your accusations weren't convincing enough to sway the Elders. This will reflect badly on you, and you now have a probably lasting nemesis that won't forget the trial you put them with.\nJustice truly is blind, or at least not friendly to you for the moment being."
 pod_lasombraevents.10.a: "Clearly, their bribed the judges!"
 
 sentenced_court_blood_modifier: "Sentenced by the Court of Blood"
 sentenced_court_blood_modifier_desc: "This Lasombra has been found guilty of being unworthy by the Court of Blood. They are now fair game for diablerie as far as their clan is concerned."
 
 pod_lasombraevents.11.n: "Trial and Success"
 pod_lasombraevents.11.desc: "The Court of Blood has given his final verdict and it's a good one for you. Your opponent has been found wanting, unworthy of the great Lasombra's blood and your accusations were convincing enough to sway the Elders. This will reflect well on you, and you now have a cornered nemesis that is officially open for "reclaiming of the blood".\nJustice truly has been served."
 pod_lasombraevents.11.a: "I love our judiciary system."
 victory_court_blood_tt: "Your opponent will now have a negative modifier for 30 years. During this time, a [diablerie|E] on them will cost no piety and will not be considered a murder."
 end_lasombra_cw_tt: "The Lasombra civil war ends. The Petition for Sanctioned Diablerie [character_interaction|E] is now usable on all Lasombra, and not just your side of the civil war."
 
 pod_lasombraevents.12.n: "Inner Workings of the Clan of Shadows"
 pod_lasombraevents.12.desc: "Clan Lasombra thrives on a system of ruthless social climbing, only the best are allowed to be a part of this august lineage. The Amici Noctis are a secretive body of Elders tasking themselves into making sure that no unworthy ever inherits for long the blood of Lasombra. To that extent, they have formed the Courts of Blood, a judiciary body that allows anyone to petition them to ask for the permission to perform the dreaded [diablerie|E] on another Lasombra that has proved unworthy.\nThe current Lasombra civil war has divided the Courts between the [ashirra|E] and the loyalists and each side doesn't recognize the authority of the other anymore. \n #X As a Lasombra, you can Petition for Sanctioned Diablerie on any other Lasombra as long as they are on your side of the civil war. If the civil war was to end, the Courts would once again have authority over all Lasombra.#!"
 pod_lasombraevents.12.a: "I will stir clan Lasombra towards its destiny."
 pod_lasombraevents.12.b: "Perhaps I could join them..."
 member_amici_noctis_tt: "Your character is already a part of the Amici Noctis, you might be asked for important decisions regarding the clan in the future."
 not_member_amici_noctis_tt: "Your character isn't part of the Amici Noctis, you might be asked to join later on depending on their prestige and power."
  
 pod_lasombraevents.20.n: "A Shadowy Offer"
 pod_lasombraevents.20.desc: "You have been approached by a mysterious individual recently, who has made strange inquiries about you.. What should be a worrying event is instead a source of anticipation for you. Indeed, it is known that the mysterious Amici Noctis, the organization of Elders running clan Lasombra, start their recruitment process by such a method.\nYou know the rest really. If you show interest, you will be sealed inside a tomb for a couple of nights so that you might "commune with the darkness" with no distractions. Then, you will be presented before an anonymous group of Elders that will formally ask you to join the Amici Noctis.\nAll in all, this is merely a formality, if a stressful one, the real screening process happens before the abduction so, unless you do not want to take part in this tradition, you are as good as in."
 pod_lasombraevents.20.a: "I am ready to join you."
 pod_lasombraevents.20.b: "This decrepit organization isn't for me."
 join_amici_noctis_tt: "Joining the Amici Noctis might offer you new opportunities to further clan Lasombra's agenda."
 end_amici_noctis_tt: "This is a one time offer. You won't be able to join the Amici Noctis in the future anymore."
   
 pod_lasombraevents.15.n: "Are You The Law?"
 pod_lasombraevents.15.desc: "As a member of the Amici Noctis, you are expected to sit on the Courts of Blood for time to time. This isn't a dangerous process as the judges are always shrouded in anonymity to avoid retribution, but it can be a tedious one.\nTonight's case is a minor one between two unimportant Lasombra. Nobody would blame you if you just picked one verdict randomly but the ideals of clan Lasombra might demand that you still bring your full attention to even the most boring case."
 pod_lasombraevents.15.a: "The court is in session."
 pod_lasombraevents.15.b: "The court is in session..."
   
 pod_lasombraevents.16.n: "Shadowy Embezzling"
 pod_lasombraevents.16.desc: "The Amici Noctis might be a shadowy organization of powerful Elders, it still has running costs. Its multiple agents and representatives expect compensation for their work, and making sure travel is safe for the judges during the Courts of Blood is also not cheap. As such, they welcome "donations" often made by ambitious young Lasombra wanting to flaunt their wealth to the whole [Clan|E].\nSuch a donation has recently arrived your way and it is time for you to put it in the Amici's coffers... or is it?"
 pod_lasombraevents.16.a: "The Clan goes first."
 pod_lasombraevents.16.b: "Disappearing gold trick!"
    
 pod_lasombraevents.17.n: "Finding the Friends"
 pod_lasombraevents.17.desc: "The Amici Noctis hide themselves in anonymity. In their point of view, this is a necessary precaution to avoid being targeted by enemies of the clan, and be able to judge matters impartially in the Courts of Blood.\nFor younger members of clan Lasombra however, this might be seen as a proof of cowardice and weakness and many have tried over the years to uncover their identity. One such group is making worrying headway recently and you have to act. Just punishing the main perpetrator would likely suffice, but uncovering all of his accomplices would send a much more powerful message."
 pod_lasombraevents.17.a: "We will punish them all."
 pod_lasombraevents.17.b: "One culprit will suffice."
 pod_lasombraevents.17.effect.success.desc: "They have all been found."
 pod_lasombraevents.17.critical.failure.effect.desc: "They got away..."
   
 pod_lasombraevents.18.n: "Friends of the Night"
 pod_lasombraevents.18.desc: "The Amici Noctis are known as a powerful organization stirring [Clan|E] Lasombra towards their mysterious goals. But besides this political importance, they are also known as masters of Obtenebration, the signature power of the Lasombra. Even those rare Amici Noctis that aren't masters of it before their entry into the society quickly learn to master it, as is expected of their new position."
 pod_lasombraevents.18.a: "I am a master of shadows, as it should be."
 pod_lasombraevents.18.b: "I must still learn more about Obtenebration."
 pod_lasombraevents.18.c: "I must work on learning it as soon as possible."
 
 pod_lasombraevents.19.n: "Taking Credit"
 pod_lasombraevents.19.desc: "The Amici Noctis handle many threats to [Clan|E] Lasombra, be they internal or external. One such threat emerged in your area and the organization was quick to show support and offers you the means to deal with it decisively.\nYour court is praising this perfect victory and it is time for you to reveal that the Amici Noctis were an important help in this matter, to further clan unity... or you can just glorify yourself instead and gloss over their participation."
 pod_lasombraevents.19.a: "Yes, I am pretty great."
 pod_lasombraevents.19.b: "I had help."
