 podgangrel.1.t:0 "The Rite of Status : Tall Tales"
 podgangrel.1.desc:0 "When two Gangrel meet each other for the first time, of after a long absence, they commonly partake in the Rite of Status. This event is seen as a way to reinforce the bonds between clanmates or, for more aggressive vampires, quickly assert their superiority.\nThe first trial is often the contest of boasts. The two participants loudly clamor of things they could do, going higher and higher in difficulty until one of them concedes or asks for proof. When proof is asked for, the two contestants must accomplish their latest boast, which can often prove to be a tall order when both of them have been one-upping each other for a while."
 podgangrel.1.a:0 "Slay a Lupine? Ah! I can take on a pack of them!"
 POD_gangrel_challenge_interaction_succ:0 "Your opponent concedes!"

 podgangrel.2.desc:0 "You have won the contest of boasts and the mood between the two of you is improving as you now understand a bit more of each other. Still, at the end of the night, you won and you could rub this victory in your guest's face if you wanted a little boost of your own ego at their expense...\nIn any case, the Rite will continue with a friendly spar which will last until one of you concedes. This contest, while not lethal, has been the stuff of legends when two powerful Gangrel meet each other and a ruthless battle ensue to assert dominance. Perhaps you and your opponent will create such a legend with your own battle? Or perhaps just a one sided affair instead?"
 podgangrel.2.a:0 "You were weak at boasting, let's hope you are better at fighting!"
 podgangrel.2.b:0 "Nice boasts friend, now let's fight!"

 podgangrel.3.desc:0 "You have lost the contest of boasts but this is merely the beginning of the Rite. As you wonder if your partner could really accomplish the momentous tasks they boasted of, your prepare yourself for the next event.\nThe Rite will continue with a friendly spar which will last until one of you concedes.

 podgangrel.4.t:0 "The Rite of Status : Travel Tales"
 podgangrel.4.desc:0 "You have won the spar between you two and the rush of victory flows through you. Your defeated partner heals their wounds and looks crestfallen, it might be fair for you compliment them on their performance before moving on.\nThe last part of the Rite of Status is the informal spread of relevant information between you two. Gangrel move a lot and it's expected that you share anything that could help your clanmate while they are in this region. In contrast to the contest of bloats, this one is all about truths however, not empty promises."

 podgangrel.6.t:0 "The Rite of Status : Parting Ways"
 podgangrel.6.desc:0 "You were clearly more informed about the region than your partner was, meaning that they conceded this contest to you. Still, it wouldn't hurt much to be gracious about this victory if you wanted to.\nWith the Rite of Status officially concluded, you are both preparing to depart. [Clan|E] Gangrel has few traditions and no overall organization like many others, but this seemingly little occurrence helps consolidate a clan culture of sorts, hopefully paving the way for more unity in the future."
 podgangrel.6.a:0 "You were woefully ignorant."
 podgangrel.6.b:0 "I learned much, thank you."

 podgangrel.7.t:0 "The Rite of Status : Departure"
 podgangrel.7.desc:0 "With the three contests formally finished, the Rite of Status is now completed. For better or for worse, you now understand this fellow Gangrel a little more and the clan's bonds are hopefully strengthened by this event.

 podgangrel.7.a:0 "A bond has been created between us."
 podgangrel.7.b:0 "This was a pain."
 podgangrel.7.c:0 "Until we meet again."
