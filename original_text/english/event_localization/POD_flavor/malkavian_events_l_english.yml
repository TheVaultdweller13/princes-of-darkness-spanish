 podmalkavian.1.t:0 "The Madness Network : the Plague-Bride"
 podmalkavian.1.desc:0 "The Malkavian Madness Network is home to three spiritual residents that stand way above the others. Some would even say that these Coronati, childer of Malkav himself, would survive here if they were to meet their demise in the physical world.\nThe Plague-Bride is one such presence. The temple-whore of the First City was the one who comforted Malkav during his fits of madness and many Malkavians call for her during hard times. She will often appear and lift the burden but there is always a price, while the present mental illness will be cured, the seeds of future madness will be planted as well."
 podmalkavian.1.a:0 "The future is too far away to care."
 podmalkavian.1.b:0 "I'm doing just fine!"
 
 podmalkavian.2.t:0 "The Madness Network : the Clever Prince"
 podmalkavian.2.desc:0 "The Malkavian Madness Network is home to three spiritual residents that stand way above the others. Some would even say that these Coronati, childer of Malkav himself, would survive here if they were to meet their demise in the physical world.\nThe Clever Prince is one such presence. An useful ally when his deceptions are directed at one's enemies, but to attract his attention to oneself is an ill fate indeed. And you can never know which side he will take in the end."
 podmalkavian.2.a:0 "I need to be one step ahead!"
 random_scheme_exposed_tt:0 "A random hostile scheme targeting you (if any exists) will be revealed..."
 random_scheme_exposed_tt2:0 "...Or one of your hostile schemes will be revealed to the target."
 
 podmalkavian.3.t:0 "The Madness Network : the Nameless One"
 podmalkavian.3.desc:0 "The Malkavian Madness Network is home to three spiritual residents that stand way above the others. Some would even say that these Coronati, childer of Malkav himself, would survive here if they were to meet their demise in the physical world.\nThe Nameless One is one such presence. A creature of voracious (physical and spiritual) appetite, he will eat everything from your worries to your very name if he is hungry enough. Calling to him can be tempting to forget some of the most traumatic experience of vampiric unlife but there is always a cost."
 podmalkavian.3.a:0 "Blissful ignorance awaits."
 
 podmalkavian.4.t:0 "The Madness Network : the Great Question"
 podmalkavian.4.desc:0 "Metatron, the Mouth of God, the connection, the cobweb, the nerves of Malkav, Babel, the weavery, the Legion-mind, the sephiroth... The Madness Network has nearly as many names as there are Malkavians in it but, at the end of the night, no one really knows what it is.\nFor many Malkavians, it doesn't even warrant an explanation, it just is. But a few inquisitive minds want to know more, and travel its spiritual expanse in hopes of one night finding a solution. Are you one of those?"
 podmalkavian.4.a:0 "I need an answer!"
 podmalkavian.4.b:0 "It just is really."
  
 podmalkavian.5.t:0 "The Madness Network : the Twin"
 podmalkavian.5.desc:0 "An unspoken rumor among clan Malkavian is the existence of one lost [antediluvian|E] named Malakai. Some say she was the twin of Malkav himself and that, worryingly, she could be even more dangerous and mad than her brother. In some interpretations of the myth, the forced separation between the two a long time ago is what caused the fragmented psyche of the founder of your clan.\nTrue or not, you can sometimes feel a pull in the Madness Network, close to someone lulling you into giving up all your troubles and finally finding peace far from the cutthroat politics of the undead. A tempting proposition to be sure..."
 podmalkavian.5.a:0 "Peace at last?"
 podmalkavian.5.b:0 "I have work to do!"
   
 podmalkavian.6.t:0 "The Madness Network : the Father"
 podmalkavian.6.desc:0 "Many think that Malkav, the founder of your clan, has at least something to do with the Madness Network. Maybe he uses it as a spy network, or as a way to guarantee control over your souls or maybe even the network is actually Malkav's fractured psyche manifesting in his descendants and trying to reconstruct itself?! No one knows, and likely no one will ever know until Malkav (if he really has something to do with it) reveal the truth.\nBut that doesn't stop inquisitive minds from searching for insight. Dabbling too much in the farthest reaches of this spiritual madness can have some serious drawbacks however."
 podmalkavian.6.b:0 "Sometimes, it's best to not know."
    
 podmalkavian.7.t:0 "The Madness Network : Fleeting Individuality"
 podmalkavian.7.desc:0 "The Madness Network is, above everything, a collective of Malkavians minds somehow tied together. For those diving deep into it, it can quickly become an overwhelming sensation that endanger the very sense of self of the traveler. However, for those willing to risk it, there is the accumulated knowledge of an entire clan to be found in this realm."
 podmalkavian.7.a:0 "I see everything!"
 podmalkavian.7.b:0 "I'm whole enough, thank you."
    
 podmalkavian.8.t:0 "The Madness Network : Dreams of the Past"
 podmalkavian.8.desc:0 "The Madness Network is crawling with memories. Very old vampires are here and they have seen a lot of things. Some even say that even dead vampires' memories can remain here for a time. Most of these fragments speak of a better time for clan Malkavian, when they were respected as seers and prophets and advising the greatest of emperors.\nEach Malkavian has in themselves the spark to this ancient greatness. But activating it can take a lot of efforts."
 podmalkavian.8.a:0 "I want to see the future!"
 podmalkavian.8.b:0 "Living in the present seems safer."
      
 podmalkavian.9.t:0 "The Madness Network : Dreams of the Future"
 podmalkavian.9.desc:0 "Clan Malkavian is full of prophets and seers. Such is the nature of prophecies that they are notoriously difficult to interpret but, rarely, one can truly glimpse a vision of the future. During one of your recent travels into the collective consciousness of the clan, you have been blessed with such an event. While you don't remember the specifics, you can feel a new power trying to awaken in you, something that will become crucial to your brethren in the coming decades, or even centuries."
 podmalkavian.9.a:0 "I need to master this."
     
 podmalkavian.10.t:0 "The Madness Network : Madness and Genius"
 podmalkavian.10.desc:0 "Clan Malkavian straddles the line between madness and genius more than any other clan. Their insights are sought after by any prudent Prince, but also feared for their unreliability. In the end, even Malkavians themselves don't understand the difference most of the time.\nDiving into the collective consciousness of the clan, the Madness Network, is exacerbating these two opposites to an extreme. One can come back with a new, insightful, outlook on life... or as a raving madman."
 podmalkavian.10.a:0 "Will I cross the line?"
