 POD_talmahera.10.desc: "Worrying reports of a Gehenna cult of some sorts have been reaching you and other like minded rulers of the night as of late. While most of those doomsday fanatics are harmless enough most of the time, these specific ones seemed to use their facade of harmlessness to gather intel about various things such as the major power players in the region, their weaknesses and other political assets not usually associated with Gehenna cults practices.\nThere might be a greater conspiracy at play here."

 POD_talmahera.11.desc: "If the Camarilla is a sword to the Tal’Mahe’Ra, the Sabbat is their iron club. Not all Sabbat vampires are reveling shovelheads, but there is a definite lack of constraint found only within these ranks. The Tal’Mahe’Ra has infiltrated the Sect at all levels of power and influence, including at least two Archbishops and a Cardinal. Their better asset is the freedom to seed twigs and branches of their main cults throughout the Sabbat. These groups are small, comprised of loyal and pious agents, who present diverse public faces to the Sabbat.\nDespite these success, the Sabbat is still the truest ideological enemy the Tal’Mahe’Ra has to face. The Sword of Caine seeks to make war on the Antediluvians. When Gehenna arrives, the Sabbat will undoubtedly prove the main force of opposition. When news of Antediluvian worship reach the ears of true believers of the sect, their answer is always quick and bloody.\n #N This happened because your infiltration attempt reached maximum suspicion! #!"

 POD_talmahera.12.desc: "The Camarilla is both the easiest and the most difficult Sect to infiltrate, and Tal’Mahe’Ra agents enjoy varying degrees of success in their missions. In all the ways that count, the Camarilla is the bastard love-child of meritocracy and aristocracy, and the Tal’Mahe’Ra have become masters of gaming the system to achieve power within the Sect’s political structure. Tal’Mahe’Ra agents carefully monitor the Camarilla dismissal of the Antediluvians as fairy tales and urban legends. What to do about it remains a point of contention within the Tal’Mahe’Ra. Some agents sow seeds of doubt in their cities, attempting to entice Kindred to the cults. They seek an end to Camarilla abuses by attempting to topple the corrupt Sect from inside, using its own members. Other agents foster Camarilla ignorance, nurturing and reinforcing the disbelief. The Antediluvians will have to feed when they wake, after all. What better feast than a population of weak-minded, strong-blooded vampires caught unprepared\nDespite this apparent ease, several Princes and Justicars have become suspicious enough to begin investigations. To date, no evidence of a grand conspiracy has surfaced, but it may only be a matter of time before something incriminating comes to light.\n #N This happened because your infiltration attempt reached maximum suspicion! #!"

 POD_talmahera.13.desc: "The Tal’Mahe’Ra of Africa and the Middle East is a tiny, isolationist division that does not share its secrets with the main body of the Sect. Some believe one seraph inhabits its ranks, but many know that the Hand in Africa is not overseen by a seraph at all, but a triumvirate of elders who interpret the Del’Roh’s will as they see fit. The main purpose of this division is to keep watch on the Camarilla, Ashirra, and Sabbat presences in Africa, thwart the schemes of the Setites, and to gain information on Africa’s mysterious and insular Laibon vampires. The African Hand does not often take a combative role in the region’s affairs, making it the most passive division of the Tal’Mahe’Ra. The loose hierarchy largely leaves its members to their own devices. As a result, many blood cults have sprung up under Tal’Mahe’Ra guidance, which provide a steady supply of blood, retainers, agents, spies, and informants to their masters. Despite this passivity, the African Hand isn't always subtle enough to avoid trouble, most notably from the well organized and ideologically opposed Ashirra sect.\n #N This happened because your infiltration attempt reached maximum suspicion! #!"

 POD_talmahera.14.desc: "The Followers of Set seem like an obvious addition to the Tal'mahe'Ra, as their paradigm does not deviate much from our veneration of the Clan sires. However, the Sect has been engaged in war with the Setites since the earliest days of its history. Originally stemming from competition over Enoch, millennia ago, later conflicts rose from the Serpents proving adept at manipulating both the Tal’Mahe’Ra and the Assamites into conflict.\nThough the Tal’Mahe’Ra wishes nothing more than the total destruction of this Clan, they have to proceed carefully. The Setites know a great deal about the Sect and use this information to strategically defend themselves if the Tal’Mahe’Ra moves too openly against them. This forces the Sect to abandon focus on the Setites and concentrate on damage control to preserve their secrecy.\nThe Serpents are sadly masters of this specific game as well, resulting in many Tal'mahe'Ra agents in Egypt disappearing or being outright turned to the worship of Set.\n #N This happened because your infiltration attempt reached maximum suspicion! #!"

 POD_talmahera.15.desc: "From the shadows of the Potala and Norbulinka palaces, to the gilt roof of the Jokhang temple, Lhasa is the cultural heart and soul of Tibet, as well as the Tal’Mahe’Ra in Asia. The Asian Hand’s hierarchy is rigid, placing less importance on personal gain and more on devotion to the whole. Each vampire within knows their place in the order of things, and those who step beyond the bounds of that place are dealt with decisively. This division is deeply connected with the mortals of the region, and the Tal’Mahe’Ra take a more active role in the kine’s daily lives.\nThe Tal'mahe'Ra's influence is curtailed by the simple fact that these territories are often under the control of the Cathayans, or [GetTrait('kueijin').GetName( GetNullCharacter )], and those beings can easily spot a Western vampire meddling in their affairs.\n #N This happened because your infiltration attempt reached maximum suspicion! #!"
