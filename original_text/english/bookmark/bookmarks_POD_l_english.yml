Please choose the game rules 'World of Darkness — World of Ignorance' and 'Supernatural Dominance — Mortals — the Innocent.'\n\nIf you leave the game rules set on 'World of Darkness' and 'Vampire — the Masquerade', you will get a world of non-canon vampires who are the majority of landed title characters. We highly recommend the 1230 AD War of Princes of bookmark and not this one. Still the request to play in a mostly mundane world with very few vampires is often made, so here it is.

Although the Inquisitors were initially used as tools by the elders, they soon became a greater threat to the Cainites than the Cainites were to themselves.
