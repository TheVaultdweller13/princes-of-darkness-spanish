 POD_book_of_nod_decision_effect_tooltip: "You can assemble parts of the Book of Nod or read the text.\n\nA collection of ancient texts, viewed as sacred to Noddist Cainites. It consists of multiple recensions and fragments that have been reassembled by various Kindred scholars. Traditionally, the primary transmission of Caine's story is oral, while the texts with the most important events in Cainite history are heavily guarded to protect the Cainites. Its author is unknown, though Malkav, Saulot, and even Caine are often cited to have written parts of it, if not the whole thing. Some consider the entire book to be myths or lies, a story vampires invented to explain their existence or a tool used to mislead others into thinking and acting a certain way. The oldest piece of the Book is dated to just before the time of Sumer, around 4500 BCE."
