 hellhole_desc:0 "A Hellhole is an area of the [penumbra|E] saturated with Wyrmish energies, usually due to something particularly destructive or toxic existing on the material side of the Gauntlet.

 blight_desc:0 "A Blight is an area of the [penumbra|E] damaged by the struggle between the Weaver and the Wyrm. These urban areas are thick with Banes and choked with the Weaver's webs; in some ways they represent all the negative aspects of a city, reified and squeezed down into a small area."
 broken_lands_desc:0 "A Broken Land is something right out of a tall tale. You hear tell of people finding a fork in a trail where there wasn’t one before, or a cave opening in a cliff that was solid two days ago. Horses don’t want to go down that path, and get real nervous the closer they get. Sometimes the path leads to a strange patch of wilderness where the animals don’t behave quite right — jackrabbits hunt coyotes, spiders spin webs out of silver, vultures eat the bones out of corpses without damaging the flesh. The sun might not come up for days, or the moon may shine green or red."
 vista_desc:0 "Vistas are areas within the Umbra that open up a kind of performance reflecting one of four themes: Death, Stasis, Chaos, or Origin.\n\nVistas cannot be interacted with and simply show the entity encountering them a vision of some alternative when or where informed by one of its themes. Scenes depicted show a world where something big has happened like the creation of the universe or stultifying levels of order. These Umbral scenescapes spread across your entire field of view, as if whatever was happening was right in front of you. They seem more like events than like theatres, and affect all a traveler's senses."
