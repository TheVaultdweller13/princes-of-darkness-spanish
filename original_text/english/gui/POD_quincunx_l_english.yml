 quincunx_edict_tax_modifier_desc: "The Twilight War is the more genteel method of waging shadow war among the [GetTrait('kueijin').GetName( GetNullCharacter )], and perhaps the more interesting. In many ways, it resembles a duel more than a war. The combatants fight according to prescribed rules of conduct, and a neutral party is brought in to arbitrate the dispute. The objective is not to decimate the opponent's holdings, but to accomplish a designated objective — assassination of a valued warlord, or abdication of a popular political leader, for example — with as much strategy and finesse as possible."
 quincunx_edict_army_modifier: "Midnight War Promoted"
 quincunx_edict_army_modifier_desc: "The Midnight War is the more brutal of waging shadow war among the [GetTrait('kueijin').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] — a vendetta in which each side uses any and all tactics in order to eliminate the other, and no quarter is given. Midnight war must be declared openly, in front of a ranking ancestor; once it is declared, though, there is no honorable way to end it, save some rites."
