They are mostly composed of Princes mirroring the mortal nobility. While they respect Camilla and Rome's achievements, they see hedonism and decadence as the reason behind its fall and are much more stern and disciplined than their Roman leaning counterparts.\nThe Patriarchs are conservative Ventrue cast in the classical mold. They consider themselves the chosen nobility of the night, favored by Caine himself and destined to rule. They adhere strongly to the tenets of the Road of Kings, for the most part, and cling to the old ways of doing things (which is to say the feudal traditions of Europe, which is what most of the Patriarchs knew from their mortal lives). They promote Ventrue power and do not trust change. Why should things change, after all, when they are as God and Caine ordained them from the beginning of time?\nFuture fate in Canon\nMerging with the Merchant Princes, the Patricians will become what everyone think is a true Ventrue in the modern nights."

 pod_ventrue_ephorate.669.desc:0 "Also called Antasians, the Eternal Senate is guided by the ideas of Julia Antasia, a Roman Ventrue who was a member of the Eternal Senate in that city before its decline. A paragon of the Road of Humanity, Antasia teaches her followers the importance of equality and mutual cooperation for the greater good of all. She holds to the true "old" ways of the Roman Cainites and the glory days of the Empire and hopes to recreate the achievements of the Eternal Senate. Needless to say, the Patriarchs consider the Antasians deluded at best, a dangerous rebellion in the making at worst. The Senate see the Patriarch Ventrue as arrogant, selfish elitists concerned with their own power and positions and nothing more.\nFuture fate in Canon\nWith the disappearance of their mentor and leader, the Eternal Senate will lost most of its influence to the Patricians, leaving only a few cities (such as Frankfurt) following its ideals during the coming centuries."

They celebrate his centuries long rule over Rome and the never seen before or after unity he brought to the Cainite world and feel pride about his role in purging infernal Carthage. But they are less enthusiastic about his fervent adherence to the Road of Sin and the sheer decadence he brought to Rome. As such, most Ventrue are content to talk about Camilla as a prototype of what a true medieval Ventrue should be: a strong and shrewd ruler unifying the clans behind him. But others still know the truth, Camilla was as much defined by the Road of Sin that he was by being a Ventrue and they honor both sides.\nMaybe clan Ventrue took a wrong turn after Rome's fall and a return to the good old nights might be preferable to the current course of action...\nFuture fate in Canon\nCamilla will stay a strange and contested part of Ventrue history but, for better or worse, clan Ventrue will never again experience the unity and decadence he achieved in ancient Rome."
  
 pod_ventrue_ephorate.671.t:0 "Money is Power"
 pod_ventrue_ephorate.671.desc:0 "A rising power within the Ventrue is members of the clan who make their fortune as merchants and traders rather than seeking land and domains of their own. Most of these so-called Merchant Princes are followers of the Path of the Merchant and find their strength in wealth rather than land and vassals. Not tied to any particular locale, and profiting (for the most part) from the War of Princes, the Merchant Princes have organized into various guilds and networks of contacts across Europe.\nWhereas many Ventrue disdain the Merchant Princes with their "money-grubbing" and "usury", the merchants have slowly been gathering power and influence over the years in addition to wealth. Like the Eternal Senate, the Merchants seek to reunify the Ventrue as in the days of Rome, but under a mercantile guild rather than a senate or emperor. They have begun supporting certain Cainite lords to create the right environment in Europe where they can flourish and become the power behind the thrones.\nFuture fate in Canon\nHistory will prove the Merchant Princes right as money will truly become power in the centuries to come. Allying themselves with the Patricians, the Merchant Princes will become an integral part of the core identity of the Ventrue."
  
 pod_ventrue_ephorate.672.t:0 "Honor-Bound"
 pod_ventrue_ephorate.672.desc:0 "The Ashen Knights are the Ventrue less interested in accumulating power. They instead strictly adhere to their own code of chivalry and hope for clan Ventrue to set an example of bravery, restraint and discipline to other clans instead of directly trying to rule them. Most Ashen Knights work well with the other factions as long as they consider their conduct "honorable", which is a somewhat mysterious qualifier that can vary from knight to knight.\nUnderestimated by other Ventrue, Ashen Knights are appreciated by the other clans as the seemingly less arrogant Ventrue that aren't trying to lord over them using some debatable pretext. This makes them a political force with a surprising number of allies to call upon when needed.\nFuture fate in Canon\nThe Ashen Knights will not accept the transformation of clan Ventrue spearheaded by the alliance of the Patricians and Merchant Princes. Joining the nascent Sabbat in response, they will form the backbone of the Ventrue antitribu, fighting to restore the long lost honor of their clan."
