As Tremere is known to sometimes wake up and issue his own edicts, the Councilors are always jockeying for power and influence, hoping to please their master (or at least not displease him).\nIn this eternal struggle, all Tremere play their part, creating cliques of followers praising their chosen champion and hoping to reap rewards from them when the time comes."

Tremere's thought process about this is as arcane as expected but, besides a few "odd" choices, it seems to mostly follow political lines. The more powerful a Tremere is, and the more zeal they show in the Code of Tremere, the more likely they will be to be appointed on the Inner Circle.\nAnd finally, after a stressful waiting period, you are presented with the news by the current Circle members, Tremere has chosen you. Some of them seem pleased, others unhappy but it is Tremere's will and as such, it is now a fact."
