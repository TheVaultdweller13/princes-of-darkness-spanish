 pod_tremere_council.2.desc: "The Inner Council of the Tremere handles most of the Clan's affairs in Tremere's stead. As Tremere is known to sometimes wake up and issue his own edicts, the Councilors are always jockeying for power and influence, hoping to please their master (or at least not displease him).\nIn this eternal struggle, all Tremere play their part, creating cliques of followers praising their chosen champion and hoping to reap rewards from them when the time comes."

 pod_tremere_council.4.desc: "A vacancy on the Inner Council has just opened and, as always, the entire Pyramid is waiting for Tremere's call on who will be the chosen one. Tremere's thought process about this is as arcane as expected but, besides a few "odd" choices, it seems to mostly follow political lines. The more powerful a Tremere is, and the more zeal they show in the Code of Tremere, the more likely they will be to be appointed on the Inner Circle.\nAnd finally, after a stressful waiting period, you are presented with the news by the current Circle members, Tremere has chosen you. Some of them seem pleased, others unhappy but it is Tremere's will and as such, it is now a fact."

Those powerful vampires, handpicked by Tremere himself, are the true leaders of the [Clan|E], as the founder is either in [torpor|E] or preoccupied by more important affairs. At their core, they are the defining masterminds of the House, and their doctrines and politics are to be followed by all loyal Tremere.\n #X The Inner Circle is a defining feature of the Tremere loyal to the Code.

 pod_tremere_council.7.desc: "As the highest power in [Clan|E] Tremere, besides the founder himself obviously, the Inner Council is a hotbed of intrigue and rivalries. Every Councilor wants to undermine their fellows and elevate themselves in Tremere's favor, resulting in (often quite petty) conflicts that can resonate throughout the Pyramid.\nOne such conflict has erupted recently and many are taking sides, uttering their own misgivings and rumors about the feuding Councilors to add fuel to the fire."

 pod_tremere_council.8.desc: "The shadowy war for influence among the Councilors is fought in many different ways. Gathering support from influential Tremere is one of them and one Councilor has been courting your support for some time now.

More precisely in the private library of one Councilor. You could make a formal (and quite grueling) request for use or fall back to some good old fashioned bribery. Even knowledge has a price after all."

Together, you could make great inroads into unlocking the secrets of the Blood for [Clan|E] Tremere (and for yourself). Such an association between two powerful thaumaturges tends to be difficult to work with however and it might be less stressful to instead refuse this proposal and continue working on your own."

Here lies the true power of the House of Tremere, with the handpicked Councilors laboring tirelessly for the glory of all the Pyramid.\nAt least, that's the official version.\nMost often than not, these sessions dissolve into unproductive bickering and name calling between rival Councilors and, besides insults and threats, not much is achieved. Still, if you want to make a true difference in the affairs of the Clan, this is where it happens."

The details are sketchy at best as the top of the Pyramid isn't really known to be forthcoming with information about its inner dealings. Whatever the cause of this open spot might be, the time has come for all loyal Tremere to wait for their founder's word on his choice for a replacement.\nWhile Tremere's ways are impenetrable, it might be a good time for any prospective councilor to show their devotion to the cause by proving their faithfulness to the Code."
