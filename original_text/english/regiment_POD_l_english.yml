They are also much larger than the average dog, somewhere around 15 feet at the shoulder. In addition to their maws and size, they have barbed hooks instead of fur, emit green fire from their mouths, and leave a sooty trail behind.

The coal-black lizard didn't need to travel far to find a home suitable to his needs. Unlike some of his kin. he has no wings and thus cannot fly.
