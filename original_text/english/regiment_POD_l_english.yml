Because of [oblivion|E]'s taint, however, these dogs have far more heads, mouths, and eyes than the average canine; the most spotted were ten mouths and fifteen eyes. They are also much larger than the average dog, somewhere around 15 feet at the shoulder. In addition to their maws and size, they have barbed hooks instead of fur, emit green fire from their mouths, and leave a sooty trail behind.
