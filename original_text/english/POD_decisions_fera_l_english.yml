 changing_moon_decision_desc:0 "These rites mark a Gurahl's passage from one auspice to another. The subject of the rite first undergoes a ritual cleansing, including a day-long fast and a ceremonial bath. At the end of her purification, she burns an item symbolic of her old auspice (i.e., a child's toy for Arcas, or a wooden spear for Uzmati). Next she adorns herself in clothing and face paint suitable to her new auspice. Finally, she presents herself before the other participants in the rite and formally states her name and (new) auspice. The other Gurahl greet her in return, again using her name and new auspice title. A celebration usually follows the formal portion of the rite."
