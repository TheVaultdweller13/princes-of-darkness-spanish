This Camp is not just Galliards. The Theurges seek out and learn Rites, making sure that none are lost as the Apocalypse approaches, and the Philodox preserve the ancient wisdom of past Judgments.

After a long period of tutelage, they’re taken to meet the Fae, and hopefully to join the Tuatha de Fionn as full members. The Children of Fionn not only parlay with faeries on behalf of the Garou Nation, but learn from them about many of their mutual enemies who — while not necessarily Wyrm-spawn — are likely to interfere with the Nation."

 swara_adherent_plural: "Swara"
 swara_desc: "The werecheetahs of the Bastet tribes are also called the Silver Folk. Like their kin, they are extremely fast and travel much. They also have a unique link with the [umbra|E]. Of all tribes of the Bastet, the Swara are the least understood. This is a result of their very isolated culture. Swara are the only breed of Bastet able to step sideways, allowing them to travel to realms within the [umbra|E] that their brethren are unable to reach. Some speculate that this is a result of their strong relationship to Luna, who most Swara revere. Some legends claim that it was a Swara who first visited the moon during the time of the Impergium, and it was this that taught them the meaning and importance of the war against the Wyrm and how dire the situation is."

 ajaba_religion_desc: "Ajaba are werehyenas. The legends of the Ajaba say that they are the African counterparts of the Garou, created to be Gaia's warriors in a continent without wolves. However, in part due to the division of roles among their genders, the Ajaba have spent much of their history bickering amongst each other. The most notable trait of the Ajaba is that they are strongly divided along gender lines: female Ajaba are warriors, with generally high Rage and lower Gnosis; males are mystics, with opposite tendencies. Some small number of Ajaba are born with inverted traits for their gender, and are seen as omens of great good or ill."
