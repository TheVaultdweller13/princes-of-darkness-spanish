# Political Faction Agendas

# Militants
# A great many fae are eager for the Oath-Truce to end so they can return to the engagements of the War or Seasons. The driving emotions and loyalty inspired from being Sained into a Court are fierce and are difficult to lay aside over any matter. Almost every member of the Four Courts truly believes that their way of life is the true way, be it in the form of a better world for all, or simply that the strongest deserves to rule. Accordingly, the resumption of the fae's war is not something that strikes dread in the hearts of many of the factionalized fae. In fact, quite the opposite—it is the end of a too-long delay, a signal that the battle to decide the fate of the world can finally begin. 
# Militants emerge from every Court, although the Summer Court cradles the most Militants among their number and the Autumn Court the least. The Winter and Spring Courts, though they lack the same enthusiasm for world rule that they Summer fae display, do not want for reasons to commit troops to the front when the War of Seasons begins anew.

# Truce-Bearers
# 'Truce-Bearer' is a term applied to those fae who seek to end the War of Seasons, either by extending the Oath-Truce indefinitely, or forging a new, lasting treaty that will cease hostilities between the courts. Many of this faction adopt an air of disinterest in humans. They see fae society as infinitely more important, and in immediate need of attention, than the world of mortals.  
# Other fae, over the course of the 800 years since the Battle of Stone (and especially during the 100 years of the Oath-Truce) have forged close alliances and friendships with the members of rival Courts, and are less than eager to take the field against these new comrades. 
# Finally some fae don't care if the Courts return to war; they would just rather they themselves didn't have to join in the conflict. Many of these advocate a return to Arcadia—or keeping out of the way of humanity at the very least. 
# Truce-Bearers of all Courts tend to be isolated individuals or small groups of fae who fervently work in the social arena to sway the local courts towards peace. Unsurprisingly, they are rarely successful, but this only serves to stoke the fires in their hearts. Peace, no matter the price, is their calling.

# Humanists
# The Humanist faction does not necessarily advocate kindness and tolerance when dealing with the human realm, rather it embraces an ethic that is primarily concerned with understanding humanity. First, with the emergence of several human faiths and rituals that actively repel the fae—especially the Christian practice of baptism—even many changeling admit that they no longer understand humanity the way the used to. Times have changed, and left the fae by the wayside. The humans now have numbers and power beyond what the fae themselves possess. This is a sudden and extremely sobering realization. 
# The Humanists believe that this is the time to gather information about humans, treat with them, forge new oaths, and in all ways seek a balance between the two races before it's too late. This faction is well aware that in time, it's likely that the fae will simply become irrelevant to humans, which is a factor never seen previously considered. Accordingly, while most fae are Humanist to one degree or another, members of this faction significantly populate the Spring and Autumn Courts. Many Humanists wish for a solution that will resolve the matter in their favor—what can humans do for the fae? But ultimately, the Humanists wish to achieve a level of co-dependency with humans, where the fae are acknowledged once more, and either valued and respected... or simply valued and feared.

# Constantinians

# Fae who sought to understand the details of human faith were always seen as pursuing a fairly useless path of scholarship — until now. The Constantinians have enjoyed a vast increase in membership during the years of the Oath-Truce. Named after Emperor Constantine I, these fae seek to know more of the human religions, especially the Christian Church, and are interested in doing so for potentially any number of reasons. 
# As a whole, the fae's reaction to the Church is generally an uneasy balance of fear and awe. Constantinians take this attitude and combine it with their desire to learn more of the mysteries of human faith. Some members of this agenda feel respect for humanity's beliefs and the power they now wield because of them, but just as many Constantinians feel hatred , revulsion and even jealousy.
# Those who follow this path of research and deduction tend to do so for one of two main reasons: to understand the phenomenon of faith and find a way to balance it with the fae's place in the world; or to seek any weakness in humanity's new power, and find a way to exploit it. The greatest threat posed to the fae is the practice of baptism, and the ritual is accorded a great deal of attention and study by those with a Constantinian agenda. The powers of faith that can physically repel the fae are also heavily researched—these are worrying and dangerous new developments that need to be understood.
# The Autumn and Winter Courts have Constantinians among them, although most of these fae tend to use their knowledge of the Church for their own advantages (and to humanity's detriment). The Spring Court boasts the largest proportion of those fae who seek to understand the Church for the betterment and balance of both worlds.

# Season Courts

# Winter Court
# The most brutal of all the fae, the Winter-kin lurk under bridges and in dark forests. While they are vicious warriors, most of them are not looking forward to the end of the Oath-Truce with any degree of enthusiasm.  Organized war isn't much to their liking, but preying on humanity, the thrill of nighttime hunts, the taste of blood and fear—these things are very much to their tastes. It is only the notion of plunging the world into a dark, savage night that spurs them to participate in the War of Seasons at all. 
# The monsters of human legend, the creatures in the night's shadows—the Winter-kin live to inspire terror in humanity. Largely disdainful of the War of Seasons, the Court has lost much of its drive to eventually triumph over the other factions, now seeing them as almost below notice. The Winter fae seem incapable of empathizing with humanity, having neither basis nor starting ground to understand the mortals and their lives. Changelings (and Humanists) are rare in this court.

# Winter Poem:
# Sun hides low in her sky; fearful of the shadow she creates,
# As Night sits in his dank hollow and awaits,
# For her to sink deep beneath the iced barren lands,
# Allowing the frosts to eat warmth from the blooded,
# And free the hunting creatures of the forest once again.

# Humans have always feared the things that live in the shadows.
# The Winter Court understands very little about humanity, and cares about them even less. In the darkest forests in the dread of night, these are the creatures that eat lost children and bathe their caps in the blood that remains. These are the creatures that chase anyone in their domains, running mortals to terrified exhaustion. These creatures are the reasons that humanity fears the hours after sunset.
# The Winter fae have a hatred of the other Courts that goes beyond the (mostly) rational dislike and disagreements among the SUmmer, Spring and Autumn factions. The Winter fae feel the Spring-kin are almost universally blinded by their obsession with humanity, the Summer fae are locked in the past and are suffering for their ignorance, and the Autumn Court deals with strange, foul human powers that are best left untouched. As for the Solstice fae — well, they are too spineless to even join the pathetic, rules-bound Summer Court.
# As the Oath-Truce enters its last hours, the Winter fae are hardly slavering for a fight with sharpened fangs and claws. Most members of this Court are actually somewhat apathetic about the War of Seasons. In many case, they are too removed from fae politics to keep up to speed with the latest shifting tide of alliances and betrayals; and to limit their involvement further, they often just don't care who is stabbing whom in the back over some petty local treaty.
# Many Winter fae are realists, and can see clearly that the War of Seasons is something of an unending trial. Most are more concerned with saving their own skins and protecting their domains against any human influence. It's unsurprising that their oaths with humans tend to be blunt, simple and extremely serious. To break a Winter oath usually means death, and death usually means evisceration under the claws of a savage monster.
# That said, there have been noted differences in Winter Court opinions in recent years. The Spring Court, ever seen by the Winter-kin as the most spineless, weakest collection of fools that ever called itself a Court, is gearing up for many serious engagements when the Oath-Truce falls. In particular, Seigfreid Hein's Green Blade is viewed with particular unease, as are the Other Lost Legions. The Winter Court's fighters and soldiers (such as they are) are finally realizing that the Spring-kin are hardly the toothless milksops that they once were perceived to be. In fact, Spring military activity rivals even that of the Summer Court—in intensity and ferocity, if not in size.
# Also, tentative alliances with smaller Autumn holdings, have been attempted and have met with some success. The Winter fae are not universally mindless killers and monsters—they too have a vested interest in the changes within the human realm. Of course, while the Autumn Court seeks ways to examine humanity and bend the mortals into a wieldable advantage, the Winter Court is more concerned with brining the mortals to heel and ending the sudden emergences of these powerful faiths, and with the boom of changeling populations in the other Courts.
# The Winter Court, unsurprisingly, consists of mainly firstborn and inanimae. It is the rare changeling who even surives the Saining, as such rituals are often doctored to make sure the milkling fails. Conversely, it is also rumored that many of the changelings in the Court were actually forced into being Sained. The exact mechanics behind such an accusation are not to difficult to comprehend; the threats mostlikely run along the lines of, 'Take the Saining, or be eaten." While such a proposition is anathema to the proud fae of the other Courts (and terrifying to a Solstice fae in Winter territory), it seems likely that once such a 'forced' Saining has occurred, the new Winter-king is more than delighted with her new position and powers. When this approach is not used, most changelings are stolen from families, rather than birthed. Both practices are extremely rare, however.

# Spring Court
# In this new age of both faith and uncertainty, the Spring Court seeks to understand and resolve the wounds created between humanity and the fae. In the War of Seasons, they are keen fighters, eager to achieve victory once and for all; and in the mortal realm, they seek to regain the mantle of relevance to the humans and be feared and respected once more. The Court of change and paradox,the Spring fae endeavor to change anything and everything to their advantage, before humanity either forgets them, or banishes the fae forever. Should such an impasse occur, the whole War of Seasons and all other efforts will come to a wasted end.
# The Spring fae embrace change in all forms, watching life progress over the reasons and reveling it all of its myriad variations (including the many different ways it can end). They have lost many of their greatest holdings from centuries past, but of all the Courts, they are the most adept at finding new homes and adapting to new surroundings.
 
# Spring Poem:
# Dawn cracks the pristine shell of day, new life does start,
# And the clasp of winter's crippled hand falls apart,
# The melt of snow runs down Nature's growing form,
# But with beauty of a blossoming flower,
# Comes not the strength to protect it from Her storm. 
 
# Spring is the season of birth—of bloom and growth. It is also the season of unpredictable weather, of storms and tempers, and of irreconcilable change.
# The Spring fae embrace change in all things, which is the great strength and great weakness of the Court itself. Change is not always progressive, nor is it always beneficial. Returning to the War of Seasons after centuries of tense 'peace' is a significant change, and one that many of the Spring Court are keen to act upon. Other fae, seeing the great conflict as an endeavor in futility, advocating changing tactics entirely, and wish to concentrate work in the human realm to ensure continued relevance of the fae.
# These fae are often seen as the most protective of humanity, although this is by no means necessarily an act of dedicated altruism. The Spring fae realize they must reinforce the mutually beneficial relationship between the two races, lest the fae slip from the minds of the mortals for all time. Consequently, their oaths often involve helping or protecting humans, although such weighty oaths require equally substantial pledges from the oath-bound mortal.
# A tempestous attitude, clashing interests and a lack of cohesive focus are characteristic of Spring fae—unsurprising considering the the relatively equal spread of the three Origins in this Court. Undeniably mighty, with their strength waxing as their seasonable bias would suggest, the Spring Court is ever split by the myriad differing approaches within their ranks.
# Changelings suffer no negative Courtly bias, although some rare bigotry does exist in a few individuals. Over time, the Spring Court's changeling population has slowly increased to meet the number of firstborn and inanimae, and continues to swell in the current age. Most Spring firstborn prefer to create new changelings in a labor of love or lust, rather than steal a human family's beloved infant. Children treated with particularly cruelty are often prized additions to the Court, however, rescued as they are from a life of abuse. Spring fae, while rarely kind in the human sense of the word, often have sympathy for downtrodden or helpless mortals, especially children. Such luckless humans are fertile ground for oaths and alliances.
# The tactics of the Spring Court are, as is to be expected, a clashing mix of action and intent. While the majority of the Court is of Humanist agenda, Militants and Constantinians are hardly rare. Complicating the matter further, many Humanists are all to happy to spend time throwing their skills into the War of Seasons, and many Militants advocate discussing the issues of the human realm in-between hostile engagements with the other courts.
# Currently, the Court is like a nest of ants that has been kicked over. Diplomats and ambassadors race to other local courts, both Spring holdings and hostile, other-Court domains. Other areas boast the presence of assembled companies of soldiers, who, although a hollow reflection of the grand armies of the Battle of Stone, are still formidable for their skill and dedication.
# Interestingly, the Patrons are also seeing a great increase in Spring fae joining their ranks. Most Spring fae who join the ranks of the Patrons tend to find themselves among the hidden enclaves of the Seekers or the bold and visible Vanguard.

# Summer Court
# Consisting mainly of firstborn and inanimae, the Summer Court is a bastion of traditional and self-righteous. The members of the Summer Court are alien in their views of humanity; and despite realizing full well that the mortal realm and its inhabitants have utterly changed in the last centuries, these hidebound creatures are unwilling to change alongside them. For the Summer fae, ignorance of the law is no excuse. Humanity may have forgotten many of its oaths, but that does not mean punishment should be lightened accordingly.
# The Summer Court prides itself on adherence to tradition and structure, and harsh observance of discipline. Summer fae are stern but fair masters, and their love of traditions means that they have retained many treasures and strongholds from ages past.
 
# Summer Poem:
# The pinnacle of Nature's fruits swell with the warmth of the midday,
# The fullest time of the turning year and darkness furthest away,
# A sedating calm claims beast and man,
# As the laze of summer weaves its terrible sheath,
# Shrouding the weak in a lack of will, allowing the sly to bare their teeth.
 
# Wrapped in the traditional roles of the fae, the Sumer Court is populated by living reflections of Faerie-kind's fading might. The very core of this Court is the literal embodiment of unchanging stasis; and  in the pillars of tradition and history, the Summer fae find a unique strength.
# The other Courts can scramble to change and shift to fit in with the mortal realm — that is their prerogative. The dignified Summer fae are aware of the same changes, but have made a conscious choice to resist them. Humankind has forgotten the old ways. The Summer fae have not. For these traditionalists, is time to remind the mortals of the way of things once were: renewing all of their faded ties, reminding them of all the lost customs, and restoring the upstarts to their proper place in the world.
# The Summer fae are not preparing to invade the human realm en masse, of course. Even to their alien views of humanity, it is clear that such a course would be a failure at best, and a disastrous failure at worst. Rather, they intend to renew their old ties to the mortals and strengthen the bonds that remain. Oath-bound humans are to be prized and rewarded for acting in accord with their place in the drama of the world, while oath-breakers are to be punished swiftly and definitively to the full extent of the oath's tenets. To the Summer fae, humans are strange, beguiling and intelligent creatures, but creatures nonetheless. Many of this Court believe the time for retraining these creatures has come.
# As the Oath-Truce moves into its final days, the faeries of the Summer Court are preparing for the resumption of conflict with gladdened hearts and sharpened blades. Th War of Seasons is their battle, for despite the setbacks of the Battle of Stone, the Summer fae have ever believed they would emerge as the ultimate victors. Indeed, it is the rare Summer holding that lacks a traditional (and utterly ostentatious) show of military influence. Be it war banners hanging from the rafters of a palace's throne room, or a collection of tunnels under the Earth filled with the pipes, flutes and harp-notes of an ancient war song, many of the Summer fae prize the tools of war and are fierce advocates of the Militant agenda. Truce-Bearers are almost unheard of, and those who do pursue that agenda usually do so with the single intention of  allowing their own domains more time to prepare for the eventual recommencement of battle.
# This is not to say that the Summer fae are bloodthirsty savages. In most cases, nothing could be further from the truth. In fae circles, they are often witty and urbane; and though frequently aloof, they are considered correct to a fault. Mortal eyes do not share these views, however. To humans, the Summer fae are no less than awe-inspiring creatures of legend that can bring tears of joy or fear to mortal eyes.
# Changelings re few in number compared to the firstborn and inanimae, which goes a long way to explaing the Court's alien perceptions of humanity. Even the changelings of this hidebound faction, most often stolen from families rather than born of firstborn and human couplings, tend to follow almost chivalric codes of conduct and respectability.
# The Court bears a passionate hatred of the Patrons, which stands to reason considering the Summer fae's ardent assurance that they will triumph in the War of Seasons. Also, the Solstice fae are particularly sneered at — in public, at least. In private, the Summer fae stoop to hiring the netural fae as often as any other faction (and perhaps more than some). Publicly, the Court at large detests the Solstice-kin, mainly because of the rumors that the Courtless began the War of Seasons.

The dignified Summer fae are aware of the changes with the mortal realm, but have made a conscious choice to resist them. Humankind has forgotten the old ways. The Summer fae have not. For these traditionalists, is time to remind the mortals of the way of things once—renewing all of their faded ties, reminding them of all the lost customs, and restoring the upstarts to their proper place in the world. For the Summer fae, ignorance of the law is no excuse. Humanity may have forgotten many of its oaths, but that does not mean punishment should be lightened accordingly."

# Autumn Court
# The fae of the Autumn Court seek to hide their true selves from the humans, dominating and manipulating them from behind facades of mysterious benefactors. The Autumn fae, like the Spring-kin, realize that the mortals are slowly replacing the presence of fae in their lives with the incantations to a distant God. Many work to understand humanity's new stance and restore themselves as half-hidden overlords, while others seek to use humanity and the old oaths as weapons in the War of Seasons. Mortals, for all their frailties and weaknesses, are useful because of the oaths that bind them—useful both as shields against banality and as allies in the coming conflict.
# Fascinated with humanity, even more than most fae, the Autumn-kin are contemplative and clever. Swearing an oath with an Autumn fae is much like making a deal with the devil—enticing, empowering and often deadly in the final accounting. The Autumn fae look at humans and their faith with wonder and ambition, and they of all faeries know that the next phase of the War of Seasons depends entirely on dealing with humanity.

# Autumn Poem:
# The falling colors of dusk descent with the waning leaves,
# Just as a butterfly's wings are a warning; their beauty deceives,
# For as their color spills like ink; they are dying
# Sure as the season's mists whisper it so,
# The vibrancy is a facade, as Autumn persists in lying.
 
# As the Oath-Truce nears its end, the Autumn fae set their attentions upon two factors that they believe will change everything. The Spring Court suffers under the pull of too many directions, while the Summer Court ruthless pursues a singular goal, and the Winter Court remains largely ambivalent. Many of the Autumn Court like to see themselves as more composed than their other-season kin in these times; and to a great extend, they are correct. The fae of the Autumn Court excel at seeing the larger picture and working toward their goals with this in mind.
# The War of Seasons has always been fought over the grand prize of the world itself, and the other Courts ready themselves in varying degrees to return to the fray with eyes narrowed and blades bared. The Autumn fae have opened their eyes and lowered their swords, because something is very, very wrong.
# The War of Seasons is a fool's gamble: Nigh-impossible to win, and crippling to the victors, for the Court that eventually achieves victory will be so weakened from the War that any triumph will be rendered pointless. Over and above the fae conflict, the Autmun Court's fae are directing their attentions to the fact that the world is no longer theirs in truth. The humans have bred and spawned in their many thousands across the realm, and they bring with them the alien powers and magic of their mysterious faith.
# The Autumn fae realize that no matter which faction conquers all in the War of Seasons, what comes after the conflict is the truly important aspect in this day and age. The humans have magic from their invented Divine overseer, which makes many fae wonder if the One Aove is indeed a mortal invention or not. Since the age of openly declared fae rule, the face of the world has altered too significantly to simply reveal themselves to the humans and expect fear, adoration and respect. Now, different methods must be employed if the fae wish to achieve their goals. The War of Seasons can wait. Now is the time to take stock of the world and see what the great war is actually being fought for.
# Humanity can be a great weapon for the fae. The Autumn court, comprised almost entirely of Changelings who excel at this kind of deception and bargaining, offers Faustian deals and oaths to needy (or greedy) mortals. A shield against Banality and a source of both religious lore and allies and contacts, the Autumn fae view humanity as a useful commodity indeed. In addition, as a vast majority of the Court's fae are changeling, they are also view humanity as the principle source of "recruitment." Many Autumn fae, protective of their true natures and their desires for humanity to never understand the fae entirely, prefer to steal human children and raise them as changelings rather than take mortal lovers.
# The Autumn Court is flooded with Constantinians, who make tentative contacts with select mortals in their immense undertaking to comprehend the complexities and power of human faith. The power of baptism terrifies the Autumn fae more than any other Court, both because the Court largely consists of changelings, and because they have learned the most about the intricacies of human faith. Baptism itself is unanimously regarded with horror, for a ritual that can immediately counteract a Saining and wash a fae clean of his mystical powers is seen as nothing less than a fate worse than death. The Autumn-kin are pragmatic, however. Rather than seeing the Church as an enemy to be opposed and halted, they view it as a mystery to be revealed, opened and studied. Once the power of mortals' beliefs is understood, perhaps even the Mists will return to their more benevolent balance. 
# Currently, many Constantinians are finding new allies among the Humanists of the Spring Court; and although the Autumn Court's Truce-Bearers and Militants are mostly interesting rarities, they do exist are acting on their own agendas.
# The Patrons appare to lack Autumn members, purely because the majority of the Vanguard, visible to society, are not from this Court. The Seekers and Austere Conclave, however, boast more than their share of Autumn fae, drawn as they are to the inner workings of both the fae and human realms.

# Solstice Court
# Courtless and scattered, the unSained are the neutral faction in the War of Seasons. While most are ignored, disregarded or simply despised, the Solstice fae can also make mercenaries and diplomats of extraordinary skill and usefulness, due to their unbiased stance in the whole conflict. A Solstice fae can be either a great boon to an oathcircle, or a great burden, depending on the local fae and their opinions—and the Solstice-king's personal skills. Many of them ignore fae society completely and exist on the fringes of domains, while others carve out what lives they can as sell-swords and couriers for the high and mighty Courts.

# The Courtless fae first appeared after seasonal rule was instituted. Some fae, the story goes, refused to be part of the seasonal rule. They wold accept nothing less than true rule. Most Fae regarded this attitude with amusement and contempt, and turned such fae out of their Courts. These outcasts wandered from place to place, and eventually began acting as couriers and mercenaries to survive. The Solstice fae, as they have become known, still perform those duties today.
 
# Solstice Poem:

# We have no great song. No poem. No words. And yet,we are beholden to none; slaves to

# neither the seaons' turning nor destiny's wheel.
# They are pitied by the Spring Court, disregarded by the Autumn Courtiers, hated by the Winter-kin, and publicly despised by the Summer fae. The main accusation aimed at the Solstice fae, however, is one of stupidity. The fact is that a fae who remains unSained and unallied with a chosen Court has no claim to the human realm once the War of Seaons is won.
# Every Sained fae, eve if they are not fighters or soldiers, believes that their Court's ideology is the truest and best plan for the new world order. In the face of such dedication and fanaticism, the Solstice fae simply shrug and declare no interst, no allegiance and no desire to partake of the final prize—the world itself.
# The fact that most Solstice fae don't even hold oaths with humanity adds another layer of disadvantage to their situations. Oaths, in their most basic form, are shields against banality. Solstice fae, lacking even this basic defense for their unSained souls, are accordingly vulnerable in the human realm.
# The reputation of this faction is tattered further by the slander of the Winter and Summer Courts, for both have inner factions that hold vague legends claiming the entire War of Seasons was started by a faction of the Solstice fae known as the Coterie of Drail to be true. A few fae alive today claim to have met Drail, even though their meetings with him would have dated many years after the commencement of the War of Seasons. He is not a name spoken with kindness.
# For all their perceived vulnerabilities, Solstice mercenaries are the hirelings of choice in the War of Seasons. It is safer to acquire the services of the Solstice fae over any Sained fae, because the Courtless have no predetermined or pre-sworn loyalties. As soldiers, diplomats, message-bearers, spies and ambassadors, the Solstice fae are in their element.
# Ofcourse, everyone has a price. The Solstice fae are no exception, and it's possible that a hireling will defect or betray secret information. This is always a risk for the employer, but many Solstice fae have earned their reputations for reliability through years of diligence, effort and conflict.
# With such chaotic roots, its hardly surprising that the Solstice fae are not divided equally among the three Origins. Firstborn are by far the most numerous, followed by inanimae and changelings. While not specifically rare, changelings are certainly outnumbered by the othe Origins due to the Solstice fae's lack of oaths and associated relations with humans. Solstice firstborn are notoriously proud and difficult to deal with unless a respectful attitude is shown. Many of this creed of Solstice-kin see themselves as the elite of the elite—they are true-blooded fae, above the limitations that Court-bound fae must endure. In fact, it is these fae in particular who are eager for the Oath-Truce to finally fall, so that they can begin accepting military contracts in addition to the negotiations and diplomacy. These tend to be the Solstice-kin that make the most desirable and keen hirelings.
# While the War of Seasons close to breaking out once more, and the Courts, factions and agendas swelling with conflicting tensions and ideologies, it goes almost without saying that the Solstice fae will see a great deal of action before too long—either as instigators and mercenaries if they are shrewd and careful... or merely arrow-fodder if they are not.

While the Mannikins have no yearly ritual, rumors persist of time stolen on New Year's Eve between 11:59 and Midnight. People whisper that in that minute all the Toys awaken and live out a whole day fully human then return to their Anchors and time rewinds to Midnight again. IF it were true, it would help explain how the Dolls know so much that remains hidden to the other empires."

 eshu_religion_desc: "The Eshu have their own codes of conduct that differ from the courts of the Sidhe. Those who follow the ways of honor and tradition prefer Ojo, or daylight, fae. Those who follow their philosophy of casting off old ways and indulging passions, a death of tradition, call themselves Iku, or death. Don't think this means that all Ojo are kind and generous or all (or even most) Iku are murderous revelers. Both groups follow Uhuru. It can be as bad to be caught in the hands of an Ojo judge who will not bend as it is to be caught by an Iku with a grudge. The Eshu attach no stigma to these philosophies, except in extreme cases, because of all the fae they see themselves as individuals. Judge an Eshu by his chosen "court" at your own peril."

It comes naturally and most Elegbara draw strength from the millennia of traditions and history tied up in it. They do not, however, follow the Seelie Code (which they predate). They have their own standards to judge themselves by, though they will still uphold the Seelie which usually doesn't conflict. The Eshu simply have different core values.\nHeed the Call of Fate — All Ojo believe that the orishas ordain everything that happens.\nPass On What You Have Heard — If one doesn't remember history we repeat the same mistakes. A story forgotten is a blow against all Fae.\nSeek Justice for Those Unheard — Eshu feel a kinship with other marginalized peoples and do their best to help."

They know the Ojo see them as a joke and a nasty, bitter one at that and the moment the rest know, you drop down a few notches on their list. Many think that because they don't bow down to destiny that they aren't real Elegbara but they have a code to. Though not so exactly like the Unseelie, they mesh alright.\nThere is No Destiny — What does this mean? They are truly, ultimately, Free!\nLeave Trouble in Your Wake — Chaos snaps people out of complacency.

Through their own dark sorceries they, too, figured out how to maintain their bodies and avoid falling into nothingness as did the other Hsien.\nThe Daityas work to encourage the coming of the [sixth_age|E]; to bring about a time when the August Personage of Jade is forced from his Celestial Court and the Dragons and Phoenixes war against each other in a bloody conflagration. By promoting lack of belief, they seek to weaken the wall created by the August Personage and so claim their rightful place in the Celestial Court.\nThough misguided in the eyes of the other Hsien, they are not beyond redemption.

Most are dark reflections of the original Hsien and some answer even prayers, on condition that they involve bloodshed and satisfaction of darker urges.

They seek to bring about the Age of Joy by convincing everyone to have a good time. Rapture, exultation, and not mere physical ecstasy is their goal. They understand that a good dinner with family and friends is more satisfying and sustaining a joy than a handful of pills. The Gods of Harmony act on their beliefs by doing good deeds, trying to get different courts of shen to work together or at least talk. They walk, and occasionally party, just like they talk.\nThe Ambassadors of Heaven are looked askance upon by the Li Shen and their relations are strained with the Yü as well.

Xian Mo is a name other Hsien give them.\nThe Quiet Ones, though, give the Shinma hope, which most gave up at the end of the [fourth_age|E] when the Wall barred them from the [spirit_world|E]. Hanuman brought the [tao_te_hsien|E] to a Komuko sage in the Di Fu. The Komuko resigned their position and retired to the mountains. Eventually their teachings lead to the writings now called the [tao_te_hsien|E], or "The Way of Imminent Hsien Power."

They dredge up ancient rivalries and long-forgotten wrongs all to disrupt the order of the Li Shen ministries.

The Yü have hoarded jade for centuries and possess some of the most powerful jade artifacts to this day. They also control many Dragon Nests.\nNot all of the Yü are nobles, though. Some are only powerful warlords and criminals who control powerful Tongs and Triads. These Shinma go toe to toe with other Shen who have interests in the less lawful business dealings of the Middle Kingdom like the [GetTrait('kueijin').GetName( GetNullCharacter )], Kindred, and others.
