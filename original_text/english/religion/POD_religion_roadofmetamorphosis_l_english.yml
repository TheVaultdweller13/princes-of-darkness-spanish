 pathofasakku_desc: "This version of the path is non-canon and has been commissioned by a Patron\nA wandering mystic, Dragastes used his Vicissitude to heal the sick and wounded of both Kine and Kindred alike. However, With every healing, his tainted blood spread to the masses, rotting them from the inside out and corrupting them into mere extensions of the Asakku’s will. Potentially Dragastes’ curse may have spread across much of the Mediterranean. However, the Asakku, or more correctly the Watcher’s who dominated his will, had underestimated the other Kindred of the City. The Dracon, an ancient Tzimisce whose knowledge of Vicissitude eclipsed even that of the Asakku, rooted out many of cults and swiftly drove the rogue Tzimisce to flee the city. However, some remnants of Dragastes’ madness remained in the fringes of ancient Byzantium, though centuries of preparation and plotting had been undone in a brief few years. The cult has since migrated to the wastes of Siberia led by their Hierophant Matthaios Yelbeghen."
