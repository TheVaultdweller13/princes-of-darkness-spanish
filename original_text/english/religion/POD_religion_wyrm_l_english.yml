 wyrm_religion_desc: "In the theology of the Garou, the Wyrm is one of the higher Celestines. The Wyrm's purpose is the cleansing and rectification of Creation, furthering its descent into Entropy. He achieves this by eliminating that which the Wyld creates and the Weaver structures.\nWith the advent of humanity, the Wyrm was progressively constrained until he was driven mad, hellbent on destroying everything. Consequently, the Wyrm is now a spirit of destruction, chaos, darkness, and corruption, the essence of everything the Garou oppose."

 wyrm_adherent_plural: "Tainted"
 wyrm_desc: "In the theology of the Garou, the Wyrm is one of the higher Celestines. The Wyrm's purpose is the cleansing and rectification of Creation, furthering its descent into Entropy.

 beastofwar: "Beast-of-War"
 beastofwar_adj: "Calamity"
 beastofwar_adherent: "Warrior"
 beastofwar_adherent_plural: "Warriors"
 beastofwar_desc: "Beast-of-War is one of the three heads of the Triatic Wyrm. It is the Wyrm of Calamity, a monster of senseless rage, ready to destroy all in its path. Limitless rage fuels it, and destructive instincts guide it. Its minions range from self-destructive shock troops that hurl themselves pell-mell into battle to hulking brutes who delight in overpowering and annihilating their victims. Acting through humans, the Beast-of-War can degenerate healthy competition into brutal conflict, culminating in bloodlust that makes no distinction between friend and foe."

 eaterofsouls: "Eater-of-Souls"
 eaterofsouls_adj: "Eater-of-Souls"
 eaterofsouls_adherent: "Eater"
 eaterofsouls_adherent_plural: "Eaters"
 eaterofsouls_desc: "One of the three aspects of the Triatic Wyrm, the Wyrm of Consumption who seeks to devour all of creation, feasting on matter, energy, and spirit with equal relish. The Eater-of-Souls gluts and bloats itself while feeding on foulness in the world. The Eater-of-Souls is a mockery of the mad Weaver’s need to contain everything within its influence: it's mindlessly driven to devour all creation in a desperate attempt to destroy an inherently broken cosmos."

 defiler: "Defiler"
 defiler_adj: "Corruption"
 defiler_adherent: "Defiler"
 defiler_adherent_plural: "Defilers"
 defiler_desc: "The Defiler is a scheming entity of ruin and decay, a manifestation of every corrupting impulse and instinct in existence.  The Defiler conquers by tempting its prey to succumb to its own base instincts, leading the defiled to take reckless risks. Its victims walk a shadowy path from personal choice to annihilation of the self. Some Shadow Lords assert that the Defiler's first victim was itself. They say it's now driven by its own self-loathing, foolishly believing that if it defiles everything, it will regain control and restore balance."

# Seventh Generation might be a bit much for the mod. Maybe we need a Black Dog game rule.
 
# "A Wyrm cult involved in the ritual abuse of children, it encouraged child abuse in order to damage children so much that when they grew up, they would not only perpetuate the cycle, they would also be ripe for corruption by the Wyrm. They serve the Defiler, the Wyrm of Corruption."

 foebok: "Foebok"
 foebok_adj: "Fear"
 foebok_adherent: "Feared"
 foebok_adherent_plural: "Feared"
 foebok_desc: "Fear is the strongest and oldest emotion that mankind knows. The Wyrm is no different in this manner: realizing it was trapped, it panicked and thus this urge was born. Fear can drive any creature to do the most terrible things. All aspects of the Triatic Wyrm seem to express fear, and no Maeljin really serve it, for fear is in everything. However, when Black Spiral Dancers wish to approach Foebok, they call on Hakaken, the 'Heart of Fear.'"

 mouthofvorax: "Mouth of Vorax"
 mouthofvorax_adj: "Greed"
 mouthofvorax_adherent: "Mouth of Vorax"
 mouthofvorax_adherent_plural: "Mouths of Vorax"
 mouthofvorax_desc: "The Mouth of Vorax, a cult dedicated to the demon "Vorax" — the Urge-Wyrm Vorus. It is centered around ritual cannibalism.\nGrowing from a desperate attempt to bring creation back in its control, Vorus grasps at everything within its reach. It is uncaring about why it has what it gains, only that it has it. There are not any Maeljin for this urge, because of the nature of the beast. Giving up something of yourself to imbue a human with your power means you have less of something. Dancers invoke Relshab, the "Faceless Eater", to intercede for them with this Wyrm.\nIt is known to the Shadow Inquisition as the deadly sin — 'Avaritia'."
 
 mahsstrac: "Mahsstrac"
 mahsstrac_adj: "Power"
 mahsstrac_adherent: "Ambitious"
 mahsstrac_adherent_plural: "Ambitious"
 mahsstrac_desc: "One of the youngest and perhaps the most evolved, Mahsstrac grew out of the Wyrm's realization that it was helpless to do anything while imprisoned, and could only influence the world outside by manipulating lesser entities into doing its bidding. It cultivates a sense of authority and leadership in its targets, causing them to seek out dominance and control as a means to an end. They become brutal tyrants and dictators. Once again this particular Urge does not have need of a Maeljin servant, as it can function on its own. Spirals call upon the mighty and well known totem Incarna known as Green Dragon, 'Destroyer of Life and Crusher of Enemies'.\nIn Latin, it is referred as 'Superbia', a deadly sin of the Catholic Church."

 karnala: "Karnala"
 karnala_adj: "Lust"
 karnala_adherent: "Lustful"
 karnala_adherent_plural: "Lustful"
 karnala_desc: "With the Great Serpent entrapped by the Weaver's web, the Serpent yearned for release, for freedom, for what it wanted more than anything else. As this yearning grew, so did Karnala. The object for that desire was lost, for Karnala was able to gain freedom, while the Wyrm was left to rot. Karnala represents the state of desiring, desiring for anything: object, emotion, person, or place. Those touched by this Urge have difficulty seeing past their own gratification. Soon they are consumed by their own desire and try not only to own what they want, but try and become that thing, thus furthering the endless desire. The Maeljin Incarna serving this Urge is Empress Aliara, the Countess of Desire."

 abhorra: "Abhorra"
 abhorra_adj: "Hate"
 abhorra_adherent: "Hateful"
 abhorra_adherent_plural: "Hate"
 abhorra_desc: "The Wyrm has a lot to resent, and as this resentment fed in on itself, it soon gained enough energy to break free, not only becoming the root emotion of malevolence, but also innate self-loathing that turns one upon others. Touched by this Urge, mortals become repelled by a person, or a group of people, situations, or even minor things that remind them of imperfections in themselves. They become more and more aggressive, going to great lengths to provoke hostilities upon those they hate. The Duke of Hate, Lord Steel, is Maeljin to this Urge.\nDespite its warmongering in the Crusades, the Catholic Church regards wrath as deadly sin — which they call 'Ira'."

 angu: "Angu"
 angu_adj: "Cruelty"
 angu_adherent: "Cruel"
 angu_adherent_plural: "Cruel"
 angu_desc: "Far more abstract and complex than most of the other Urge Wyrms, Angu came far later than most of the others. It is believed to be derived from Abhorra. When first explaining its state of imprisonment and anguish to potential allies, it found that it could not express itself adequately enough. Instead it wished for a way to show them what it was experiencing and what it was feeling. Angu made this possible. Working on a subconscious level, it drives its victims into ignoring their empathy and understanding of other beings' pain. Those possessed by this Urge learn how to inflict all forms of abuse: mental, physical, or even emotional."

 baashkai: "Ba'ashkai"
 baashkai_adj: "Violence"
 baashkai_adherent: "Violent"
 baashkai_adherent_plural: "Violent"
 baashkai_desc: "Basic, crude, and mindless are words describing this Urge. It grows from an ingrained compulsion to continue conflict long after its goal of escape was met. While he can cloud the judgment of others, he can do little in the way of forcing himself into another who consciously rejects him. However, with all the other Urges he can easily provoke and make mortals give him an entrance into their souls. Chieftain of Rage, General of the Armies of the Wyrm, and Patron of Abuse, The Hellbringer is the engine of brutality for Ba'ashkai."

 khaaloobh: "Khaaloobh"
 khaaloobh_adj: "Consumption"
 khaaloobh_adherent: "Spore"
 khaaloobh_adherent_plural: "Spores"
 khaaloobh_desc: "Only vaguely understood, and only rumored to really exist, Khaaloobh has been denoted as the Urge of Consumption, indulgence, and decay. When the Wyrm convulsed strong enough in the webs, he distorted the immediate area around it. This signifies a breaking of the order around it. And whilst it is not broken, the web is definitely not in order. This urge even affects the Wyrm's minions, causing them to break down, whether it be mentally, emotionally, or even physically. The Dancers turn to Dark Fungus when wanting to reach this Urge and his Maeljin is known as Knight Entropy, the Wyrm's Spawn."

 pseulak: "Pseulak"
 pseulak_adj: "Deceit"
 pseulak_adherent: "Deceiver"
 pseulak_adherent_plural: "Deceivers"
 pseulak_desc: "The moment the Wyrm started to deny what had happened to it, and that it would not soon be let free, this urge was brought forth, fully formed with a life all its own. While deception is a natural survival tactic, Pseulak takes this to a different level. It encourages others to lie, and do it with more and more ease, becoming either comfortable in the lies they have spun, or topping more lies to cover the lies. Soon they will find themselves believing their own falsehoods. The Fallen tribe appeals to this urge with Kirijama, the 'Hidden Foe', and its Maeljin is Corruption's Advocate, the Chamberlain of Lies, the Honorable Maine duBois, Esquire."

 sykora: "Sykora"
 sykora_adj: "Paranoia"
 sykora_adherent: "Paranoid"
 sykora_adherent_plural: "Paranoids"
 sykora_desc: "The Urge of Paranoia was formed when the Wyrm first sensed the severing of its connection with the rest of creation, and with the world against it came its own personal distrust. Sykora lurks in the shadows of the mind, between the irreconcilable senses of how things should be and how they truly are. In this space, it builds complex and irrational mental constructs that go against rational thought, causing people to withdraw into themselves or lash out at those that do not agree with their notion of reality. Black Spirals contact this Urge using the tribal totem Whippoorwill and The Archbishop of Madness, Doge Klypse is its Maeljin."

 cultofdespair: "Cult of Despair"
 cultofdespair_adj: "Despair"
 cultofdespair_adherent: "Despaired"
 cultofdespair_adherent_plural: "Despaired"
 cultofdespair_desc: "A cult dedicated to the Nameless Angel of Despair, an umbrella term for a number of cults and fringe groups that have committed mass suicide in her name.\nFinally exhausted from struggling against the webs, the Wyrm lost all hope of gaining the merest freedom. This only quickened the corruption, decay, degradation, and widespread loss wrought by the other heads of the Hydra. Gree, the Urge Wyrm of Despair, eats at one's will, grinding out hope of ever bettering oneself, and making one focus on one's mistakes. The Despair eats at them, and they slowly give up on trying anything."

 lethargg: "Lethargg"
 lethargg_adj: "Apathy"
 lethargg_adherent: "Sloth"
 lethargg_adherent_plural: "Slothful"
 lethargg_desc: "Considered to be the child of Gree, this Urge came after despair. With nothing to do but wait, the Wyrm grew uncaring of what its real fate was. Like with despair, victims become at a loss what to do. Cutting themselves off from their emotions, they contemplate suicidal thoughts, with little or no regard to whom they may affect. Though some see it as the weakest link in the chain of the Urges, perhaps its greatest evil is when nobody bothers to do anything to help these souls. The Maeljin of this Urge is The Master of Stagnation, Lord of Disease, Thurifuge.\nThe Catholic Church regards Lethargg as a the deadly sin of sloth, which they call 'Acedia'."

 hrugg: "H’rugg"
 hrugg_adj: "Sludge"
 hrugg_adherent: "Sludger"
 hrugg_adherent_plural: "Sludgers"
 hrugg_desc: "The Essence of Sludge, is an elemental spirit of the Wyrm. H’rugg is the distorted counterpart to the element of earth and is composed of the solid portions of the Wyrm’s form. Its corrosive nature transforms anything it touches into more sludge. In a more diluted form, it is poisonous, causing sickness, both physical and mental. It makes victims cling to their beliefs even when presented with clear evidence that disproves them."
 
 hoga: "Hoga"
 hoga_adj: "Smog"
 hoga_adherent: "Cougher"
 hoga_adherent_plural: "Coughers"
 hoga_desc: "The Essence of Smog, is an elemental spirit of the Wyrm. Hoga is the corrupted version of the element of air, composed of the gaseous parts of the Wyrm’s body. Its noxious fumes poison or corrupt creatures who breathe it. This element manifests in the physical world ind the dark medieval from the prophetic fumes of the Oracle of Delphi, various sinkholes forming "Pits to Hell", the foul smoke of burning pitch of Castle sieges and smoking rituals of various mystery cults. Limited exposure produces shortness of breath and muddled thoughts, while larger amounts cause breathing disorders like asthma and fatal lung diseases." 

 furmas: "Furmas"
 furmas_adj: "Balefire"
 furmas_adherent: "Cancerous"
 furmas_adherent_plural: "Cancerous"
 furmas_desc: "Furmas is both the Wyrm’s perversion of fire and the spiritual manifestation of radioactivity. Composed of the Wyrm’s blood, balefire twists and warps whatever it touches. Found naturally deep within the earth. Balefire is by far the most popular element used by the Black Spiral Dancers. The day that Balefire becomes common place the Apocalypse is at hand." 
 
 wakshaa: "Wakshaa"
 wakshaa_adj: "Toxin"
 wakshaa_adherent: "Toxic"
 wakshaa_adherent_plural: "Toxic"
 wakshaa_desc: "The Essence of Toxin, is an elemental spirit of the Wyrm. Wakshaa is the Wyrm's deadly parody of the element of water as well as the remains of the liquid portions of the Wyrm’s body. It physically manifests as a brightly colored deadly poison. In the dark medieval is is found in many corrupted wines, beers and hard liquors. In large doses, it kills instantly and poisons the victim’s flesh. In smaller doses, it produces outburst of violent emotions, causing a slow wasting sickness." 
 
 blackspiraldancer_religion: "Black Spiral Dancers"
 blackspiraldancer_religion_adj: "Black Spiral Dancers"
 blackspiraldancer_religion_adherent: "Black Spiral Dancer"
 blackspiraldancer_religion_adherent_plural: "Black Spiral Dancers"
 blackspiraldancer_religion_desc: "Also known as the Lost Tribe, the dreaded Black Spiral Dancers are the Garou who turned to the Wyrm. Once known as the White Howlers, they have been corrupted to the last after the tribe tried to take down the Wyrm by themselves."

 blackspiraldancer_adherent_plural: "Black Spiral Dancers"

 cluithi: "Cluithi"
 cluithi_adj: "Cluithi"
 cluithi_adherent: "Cluith"
 cluithi_adherent_plural: "Cluithi"
 cluithi_desc: "Within the Black Spiral tribe, however, one Camp has done its best to preserve the White Howler heritage. Cluithi still prowl the most desolate moors and forests of Scotland, imitating the appearance of their ancestors had centuries ago. They rend their clothing, proudly smear themselves with blue body paint and display Pictish tattoos. The rulers of this camp also have an elitist bent, considering themselves the nobility of the tribe. The Camp's name is a reference to the original rulers of the Pictish Kingdoms. Many Cluithi see themselves as the truest children of Cluid, the hero who first led the Picts to Caledonia."

 princesofruin: "Princes of Ruin"
 princesofruin_adj: "Ruin"
 princesofruin_adherent: "Prince of Ruin"
 princesofruin_adherent_plural: "Princes of Ruin"
 princesofruin_desc: "The Princes of Ruin maintain that the war for the Apocalypse is over and finished. They preach self-indulgence, claiming that the dying corpse of the world is now theirs to rule over and treat as they like. The triumphant champions of the Corrupter they claim indulging their own base instincts is categorically worship of the Wyrm. Princes of Ruin regard the more traditional Black Spiral Dancers as rustics and religious fanatics; violence between the two philosophies is common."

 seekersoftheancient: "Seekers of the Ancient"
 seekersoftheancient_adj: "Seekers"
 seekersoftheancient_adherent: "Seeker"
 seekersoftheancient_adherent_plural: "Seeker"
 seekersoftheancient_desc: "Dark druids of the land seeking to confer with the atmosphere and geomancy surrounding the Ancients. They don't extol the spirit itself, but call upon the virtues of its elements, invoking it indirectly to act through nature. This grants them insight and power indirectly, allowing them to develop and direct a Pit that has been bonded to the surrounding landscape. They serve as shamans, risking thralldom and insanity to commune with unthinkable spirits and gain insight directly."

 hellcats_desc: "When the Black Spiral Dancers attacked the annual moot of the Ceilican Bastet in Scotland, they forced some of them in the [UmbraGlossary('black_spiral_labyrinth')] in order to turn them to the Wyrm. Those who survived became the Hellcats, their usual genuine madness turned into self-destructing and mindless aggression. Awaiting the Apocalypse to honor their Dark Father, these tainted creatures bring with them their potent links to the illusionary gifts of the Fae and various Wyrm-fetishes they constructed with Bastet-like curiosity."
