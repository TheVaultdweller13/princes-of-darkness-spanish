 viacain_desc:0 "The Cainite Heresy is a heretical belief that is practiced mainly by Christian Cainites, mostly but not exclusively by Lasombra vampires. It is steeped heavily in Gnosticism and employs a flock of human priests and clerics. Historically, the Heresy sprang forth from various blood cults in which vampires were worshipped as gods. Vampires, due their incorruptible bodies, their independence from the material world and the power that their [disciplines|E] grant, were regarded by some Gnostics as creatures of higher spirituality and were sought after for teachings in exchange for vitae."

They identify St. Mary Magdalene with Isis and the Gnostic Sophia. Magdalenite nunneries often serve as houses of 'temple prostitution' recalling the ancient fertility cults of the Levant — and they conceal bitter, blood-soaked rituals of castration an cannibalism from the darkest mysteries. Any lustful priest knows where his most lurid thoughts can find satiety, and common folk have begun identifying St. Mary Magdalene with the nameless 'woman taken in adultery' thanks to the cult's excesses. The almost pornographic 'passion plays' put on the Magdalenites on July 22 Feast of the Magdalene have been thundered against by priests across France. The Followers of Set deliberately send their brashest and least subtle members to begin Magdalenite sects."
