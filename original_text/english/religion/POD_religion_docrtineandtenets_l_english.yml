 doctrine_werewolf_veil_name: "The Veil"
 doctrine_vampirethemasquerade_strict_name: "Strict Masquerade"
 doctrine_werewolf_veil_shall_not_lifted_name: "Shall Not Be Lifted"
 doctrine_vampirethemasquerade_strict_desc: "The Silence of Blood is strictly enforced. Many kindred chafe under such draconian enforcement.\n\nMake not friends among the Poets, they will sing too much of you.\n\nBe not known. Seek shadows.\n\nLet not the priest, poet, or peasant see you feed. Not none of them will leave it be.\n\nWhen the Cross has a point, find your safety."
 doctrine_werewolf_veil_shall_not_lifted_desc: "The Veil is poetic term for the false assumption that the supernatural does not exist, which the Delirium reinforces. The Veil was formally instituted through the Concord of nine thousand years ago, which ended the Impergium. The Litany states clearly that 'The Veil Shall Not Be Lifted'. Delirium helps in keeping the Veil in place. Harming or rending the Veil means a great loss of honor among the Garou, while repairing the Veil means the opposite."
 doctrine_vampirethemasquerade_lax_name: "Lax Masquerade"
 doctrine_werewolf_veil_should_not_lifted_name: "Should Not Be Lifted"
 doctrine_vampirethemasquerade_lax_desc: "Enforcement of the Silence of Blood is lax. While Kindred make efforts to conceal their existence, they also sometimes make terrible mistakes that are not punished by their elders."

The Veil was formally instituted through the Concord of nine thousand years ago, which ended the Impergium. The Litany states clearly that 'The Veil Shall Not Be Lifted'. Delirium helps in keeping the Veil in place. Harming or rending the Veil means a great loss of honor among the Garou, while repairing the Veil means the opposite. In practice, the Delirium does most of the work and Garou largely need not trouble themselves about. Some tribes see it more as a guideline than a strict rule to be enforced."

 doctrine_vampirethemasquerade_none_desc: "Vampires act without regard for secrecy from the kine.\nIt's harder to decrease your exposure with this tenet, but higher dread will reduce the risks of an Inquisitor Cell provincial revolt."

The Veil was formally instituted through the Concord of nine thousand years ago, which ended the Impergium. The Litany states clearly that 'The Veil Shall Not Be Lifted'. Delirium helps in keeping the Veil in place. Harming or rending the Veil means a great loss of honor among the Garou, while repairing the Veil means the opposite. Some werewolves find that the Veil is an obsolete idea that no longer matters. Some even actively work to bring down the Veil so that werewolves can once again reinstate the Impergium and openly terrorize all humanity."

Once the Weaver went mad and began encasing everything in Webs, the Wyrm was progressively constrained until he was driven mad as well, hellbent on destroying everything. Consequently, the Wyrm is now a spirit of destruction, chaos, darkness, and corruption, the essence of everything the Garou oppose.

Mankind is Weaver's adopted child, in order to bring order to the world and help her to end the chaos that her Celestine brethren constantly wrought upon creation. To this end, Weaver implanted mortals with three gifts, Dogma, Science, and Technology, in order to survive. It has been said that, after the Impergium, Weaver vowed to never let her children become victims of persecution again. The Weaver's avatars and children often take the form of spiders, or sometimes insects. It (or, more often, she) is a patron of law, order, science, and technology, and as such is revered by the Warders of Men and Ananasi (who refer to her as Grandmother Spider; they believe the Weaver created their patron spirit, Queen Ananasa).

Shapechangers also agree that the Triat is no longer balanced: the Weaver draws on the strength of humanity - its cities, technology, industry, and science - and is stronger than ever before. The Wyld's influence retreats as natural resources are plundered, the wild places of the world destroyed, and nature forced to do man's bidding. Most dangerous of all, however, is the Wyrm - it feeds on evil and destroys without distinction. Something holds it in check, but Garou see its power growing and fear the day it will break free to bring the ultimate destruction - the Apocalypse.
