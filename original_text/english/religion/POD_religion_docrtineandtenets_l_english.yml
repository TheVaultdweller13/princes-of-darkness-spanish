 #It is not enough for the Philosopher to passively accept the frustrations that come her way, as the Path of Humanity requires. Instead, she must hone her reason into a sword and her will into a shield against the forces that would cause her to degenerate.\n\nSophrosyne means control of the self and represents the idealized goal of all Philosophers: mastery over the Brujah rage.

Philosophers develop sophrosyne by working to improve Physical and Mental Attributes and Abilities, rather than focusing on [disciplines|E] or Social traits."

To this end, Weaver implanted mortals with three gifts, Dogma, Science, and Technology, in order to survive. It has been said that, after the Impergium, Weaver vowed to never let her children become victims of persecution again. The Weaver's avatars and children often take the form of spiders, or sometimes insects. It (or, more often, she) is a patron of law, order, science, and technology, and as such is revered by the Warders of Men and Ananasi (who refer to her as Grandmother Spider; they believe the Weaver created their patron spirit, Queen Ananasa).
