 viapeccati_adherent: "Sinner"
 viapeccati_adherent_plural: "Sinners"
 viapeccati_desc: "Followers of Via Peccati control their Beast by indulging their whims and desires, regardless of who they hurt. Failure to do as they please makes their condition worse, which means morals, ethics, and laws usually fall by the wayside as they make their way along this Road. Followers of Via Peccati are not evil per se; just completely self-indulgent."

 viavoluptuous: "Via Voluptarius"
 viavoluptuous_adj: "Voluptarius"
 viavoluptuous_adherent: "Voluptuaries"
 viavoluptuous_adherent_plural: "Voluptuaries"

 viacrudelitas_adherent: "Heartless"
 viacrudelitas_adherent_plural: "Heartless"
 viacrudelitas_desc: "The followers of the Path of Cruelty are the most cynical and hateful of the Sinners. Very much stemming from a 'hurt them before they hurt you' philosophy, the Sinners here do not believe in mercy, compassion, or pity. Rather, their only pleasure is derived from the pain of others."

 viaadversarius_adherent_plural: "Adversaries"

 viadiabolis: "Via Diabolis"
 viadiabolis_adj: "Diabolis"
 viadiabolis_adherent: "Devil"
 viadiabolis_adherent_plural: "Devils"
 viadiabolis_desc: "Being an inherently destructive Road, Via Diabolis is not considered a path to be taken lightly; those who dare follow it indulge themselves with all manner of debauchery and destruction. Many are not really evil per se, so much as believing a virtuous unlife is a fruitless pursuit. Some, however, took the role of devil seriously, even calling themselves devils incarnate and servants of Satan. The Baali in particular are associated with Via Diabolis."

 viafurores_adherent_plural: "Furores"

The Furores are considered chaotic, but they can muster a level of passion for their cause unseen anywhere else in [cainite|E] society."

 viaquiritare_adherent: "Screamer"
 viaquiritare_adherent_plural: "Screamers"
 viaquiritare_desc: "The maddest of the Sinners and the opposites of Via Adversarius, the followers of the Path of Screams believe that as they are already damned, they are also already prey to the Beast, and therefore allow themselves to be manipulated by it to do the Beast's bidding. They are essentially walking examples of Hell-on-Earth; even other Sinners are loathe to associate with these madmen."

 viahyron_adherent: "Abelene"
 viahyron_adherent_plural: "Abelenes"
 viahyron_desc: "The Road of the Hive is followed almost exclusively by the Baali of the Order of Moloch. The Road preaches all-encompassing loyalty to the bloodline as a whole and to one's [Sire|E] in particular. The main reason for this is that the Great Works that the Baali want to achieve cannot be claimed alone or when they interfere with the work of others. The vampire had to let the voices of the Swarm inside his soul in order to understand the dreams of the beings of the Outer Darkness and keep them asleep. Apart from that, most other vampires would actively destroy a Baali if he would be foolish enough to reveal himself as an adherent."

Internalists some may call us, if they knew our true intent, to ascend beyond the prison into which we have been twice-born. This road is dark, and fraught with peril, and the only light which we may find is a terrible piercing radiance, which threatens to burn our flesh and exsanguinate our very spirit."
