 dynn_balor_modifier_desc: "By the serpent that twines around the golden tower, by the crimson beam that streams from Balor’s Eye, by the blood that runs like fire through my veins, I pledge my heart, mind, and body to the will of House Balor. Let the challenge that marks my body as different from all others serve as a constant reminder of my birth and my destiny. May I suffer the agony of a thousand flames if I betray my house. This I swear, by the blood and the eye, before the [UmbraGlossary('dreaming')] itself."

 dynn_daireann_modifier_desc: "Brothers and Sisters, by the edge of the sword and the bond of blood do I swear the strength of my arms and the courage of my heart to defend you and our cause from the might of our foes. Never shall you stand alone on the battlefield as long as breath remains in my body. Should I break my oath, may a rain of iron daggers pierce my breast and send my soul forever into darkness."

 dynn_leanhaun_modifier_desc: "By the elements and the essence of Dreams, I declare before witnesses that I am ready to take up my duties within House Leanhaun. I will remain true to my house, keeping its secrets, assisting all fellow members, and guarding its treasures. If I fail in any of my duties, or should I betray my house, let my name be stricken from the histories and erased from the minds of Dreamers. Let my story be unfinished, my purpose unfulfilled, and my essence scattered by the winds. Let no Kithain recall there ever existed such as I."

 dynn_varich_modifier_desc: "One pattern I started, now I end it to begin anew in the name of Varich, founder of the house I take as my own. May I never leave the threads of a pattern unread. May I never let a challenge go unanswered. May I never give a vow of true love to another. I give honor to House Varich and serve it with my mind, my heart, and my actions. If I forswear my oath, may all hands of my house rise against me and may the pattern of my beating heart fall to stillness forever."

 dynn_danaan_modifier_desc: "For every star in the sky, there is a path to be walked. For every dream in the night, there is a journey awaiting. I swear by the stars above and the dreams within to serve House Danaan, to guard the ways of the [UmbraGlossary('dreaming')] and blaze new trails where none exist. I will guard the travelers, guide the Dreamers, and go on until there are no paths left to follow. This I swear, and may the dragon devour me in my dreams if I fail to keep my pledge."
 dynn_scathach_modifier: "Scathach"
 dynn_scathach_modifier_desc: "Today I make a vow of blood and steel, and pledge my life to House Scathach. I shall heed the words of the oracles, and pledge my blade to no cause that invites dishonor. I shall tend my own steel, keep my own counsel, and walk my own path until the day I cast no shadow. Thus I swear, by bright moon and blooded blade. And so my long walk begins."
