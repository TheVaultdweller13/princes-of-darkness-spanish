 game_concept_tao_te_hsien_desc:0 "It is not the Taoism of Lao Tsu, though it was inspired by it. Its point is for the shinma to understand his or her place in the cosmos since the coming of the Wall. Unlike the human philosophy, it has a goal... to give the hsien the power to break through the Wall and journey to the Spirit Worlds.\nIt shares many of the Tao's characteristics. Followers tend to retreat from the trappings of the world and see a life of contemplative ease in nature. They love learning for its own sake but care little for politics. Some are scientists, others priests, others beggars, others warriors. The hsien of Japan have modified it to a more Zen-like philosophy called Hsien-do and, unlike some mortal religions, the Tao Te Hsien welcomes change and individualism, as long is it doesn't become self aggrandizement. It is quiet, mysterious, and profound.\nIt has five steps which roughly correspond to the Taoist creation story, but in reverse. For the Taoists there was first Wu-Wo: Not Nothing. From Wu-Wo came Wu Chi: No Limit. this spawned Hu T'un: Chaos. In the center of this Chaos was a still point, a speck at first that became T'ai Chi: the Great Pole and from this grew Great Change: T'ai I which is divided into two stages: T'ai Chu: the Great First or form, and T'ai Shih: the Great Beginning or the First Breath (Chi). All these eventually led to the creation of the [first_age|E]: T'ai Su: the Great Primordial.\nWhy are the steps in reverse? The steps represent the struggle to return to No Limit; to break the bonds that limit the shinma's travel to the Spirit Worlds. There are many paths back to No Limit but the surest is the Tao Te Hsien. It is rumored that the Profane Gods have their own version of Nei Tan called Hac Tao or the Black Way; a way dictated by a Yama King during the [third_age|E]."
