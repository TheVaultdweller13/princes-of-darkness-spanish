 game_concept_possession_desc: "the process through which a Wraith takes ownership of a body. Whether or not possession succeeds depends on a duel between the wraith and the victim. Possession is divided into three stages and can be used several times against the same person (if you use the same wraith, of course). If a ghost bound to you possesses a victim, the target shall likewise be bound to you. Stages of possession: \n 1. In stage one, the victim gains some of the wraith's prowess on top of their own, and the necromancer and wraith gain influence over the victim. \n 2. Stage two imparts some of the Wraith's skills upon the victim, giving them a part of the ghost's stats. The necromancer gains more control over the victim. In addition, the personalities of the wraith and victim begin to meld together. \n 3. In stage three, the possession is complete, and the wraith's personality overwhelms the target. The Victim is enthralled by the wraith and gains more of its skills as the ghost acts through them. The necromancer's control grows even further."

 game_concept_obtenebration: "Obtenebration"
 game_concept_obtenebration_desc: "Obtenebration, the power to control and manipulate shadows, is the [discipline|E] from which the [Clan|E] of Shadows takes its name. Initiates of the discipline can use it to move and manipulate shadows to their advantage, while masters can give shadows form, substance, and a semblance of life. The nature of the source of this power causes no end of disagreement among Lasombra. The most ancient elders of the [Clan|E] claim that the darkness is itself a primal entity, equal and opposite to the force of creation that bears the world into being. Influenced by Zoroastrianism, the eldest usually call this dark force Ahriman. Other Lasombra believe that Obtenebration draws its power from a realm of shadow rather than an entity. Lasombra who look to one of the Abrahamic faiths might call it Hell, while an adherent of the ancient Greek or Roman gods might call it Tartarus. Whatever its origin, Obtenebration is wholly unnerving to those who see it in use. It evokes terror in animals or mortals who see the [discipline|E] in use. Even $pod_cainites$, whose very existence defies explanation, tend to see Obtenebration as an affront against the laws of nature."

They are beings of incalculable power.\nPresumably the Antediluvians are of such age and potency of blood that they possess nearly god-like power, and in fact some of them may be deities. Very few records of such power being used exist, but legends typically portray them as undefeatable.

The Einherjar see themselves as the last of Odin's warriors on Midgard, preparing to fight in the impending Ragnarok. All they can do is preparing themselves for the ensuing battle and die a hero's death.\nVampires of the north are not simply Vikings with clans. The particulars of their Norse heritage give Einherjar an outlook upon the world that is far different from many of their southern cousins.

It's control is the primary way that ghouls are managed by their domitors, through the Blood Bond — in addition to more traditional techniques like Dominate. The nastiest part of being a ghoul, of course, is that one is a slave to an inhuman monster that treats humans as chesspieces or the occasional light snack."

 game_concept_revenant_desc: "A $POD_splat_revenant$ is a kind of hybrid creature that is both like and unlike $POD_splat_mortal_plural$, $pod_ghouls$, and $POD_splat_vampire_plural$. Some would say a revenant is halfway between a mortal and a vampire; others would call it a corruption of God's creatures with the curse of Caine, mingling the two until they become inseparable. Nonetheless, a revenant has many qualities of both vampires and mortals, and has many characteristics of normal ghouls. Revenants can drink the blood of a vampire, but unlike a ghoul they do not need to do so, as they can produce their own vitae, which also retards their aging.\nUnlike their masters, and despite their name, revenants are living creatures. Like a mortal, they need to eat, sleep and breathe. They are capable of sexual reproduction. Unlike a mortal they are tougher and have access to supernatural powers from the Mark of Caine."

The Hengeyokai speak of the Age of Testing, where the treacherous $pod_wan_xian$ set the Fera against each other in an event remembered as the War of Shame. The #TOOLTIP:GAME_TRAIT,mage,[GetNullCharacter] #L Chi'n Ta#!#! remember that various different factions of willworkers sprang from this time period, and that they often clashed, as seen in conflicts like the Himalaya War or the Dragon River War.

However, most [GetTrait('kueijin').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] see the Age of Sorrow as a necessary part of existence. Likewise, the Hengeyokai believe that the coming Age of Sorrow will pose their greatest challenge. Their enemies, the Yama Kings, seek to enthrone themselves over the Wheel and keep it trapped in the Sixth Age forever, while the Great Centipede seeks to undo the wheel itself. The duty of the children of the Emerald Mother, therefore, will be to protect the Wheel from all who seek to corrupt it. The #TOOLTIP:GAME_TRAIT,mage,[GetNullCharacter] #L Chi'n Ta#!#! likewise believe that the Wheel will soon turn again, but are divided how it will affect them.

The hsien of Japan have modified it to a more Zen-like philosophy called Hsien-do and, unlike some mortal religions, the Tao Te Hsien welcomes change and individualism, as long is it doesn't become self aggrandizement. It is quiet, mysterious, and profound.\nIt has five steps which roughly correspond to the Taoist creation story, but in reverse. For the Taoists there was first Wu-Wo: Not Nothing. From Wu-Wo came Wu Chi: No Limit. this spawned Hu T'un: Chaos. In the center of this Chaos was a still point, a speck at first that became T'ai Chi: the Great Pole and from this grew Great Change: T'ai I which is divided into two stages: T'ai Chu: the Great First or form, and T'ai Shih: the Great Beginning or the First Breath (Chi). All these eventually led to the creation of the [first_age|E]: T'ai Su: the Great Primordial.\nWhy are the steps in reverse?
