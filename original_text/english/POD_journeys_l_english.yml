Furthermore, they used their arts to protect the herd the Clan cultivated. They nurtured the crops that sustained the herd and continued to strike at the forces that threatened the Clan. \nThese Sorcerers have subsequently turned their talents to the arts of Dur-An-Ki (Sumerian meaning “Master of Heaven and Earth”) to aid them in their cause. A form of magic that originated in ancient Mesopotamia, it has grown over the millennia to incorporate the trappings of numerous myths and religions from across the greater Middle East.

In Egypt's heyday, before its conversion to Christianity at the hands of the Roman Empire, magic was commonplace, practiced by mortal and vampire alike. Egyptians had several words for magic; the Setites used Heka (literally \"magic\") to refer to mortal magic, and Ahku (\"spells\") for their blood magic. This is still the most well known variant of \"Setite Sorcery\" to date."

 seek_knowledge_akhu_travel_desc:  "Akhu, the most widely practiced school of Setite Sorcery, resembles ancient Egyptian religion. The god Set to the ancient Egyptians was, among other things, the God of Storms. A practitioner of Akhu therefore erects a symbolic lightning rod through which she can attract a bolt of Set’s lightning to power her subsequent rites. However, in order to attract Set’s favor, she must make an offering to the Dark God that will please him greatly. The accepted way to achieve this among practitioners of Akhu (known as Lector Priests) is by following the instructions laid down by Set himself in The Book of Going Forth by Night."

 seek_knowledge_sadhana_desc: "Upon reaching India, the Followers of Set found elements of the Hindu religion that they could exploit to convert Kindred to their cause. Practitioners of Sadhana are predominantly drawn from the ranks of the Setite bloodline known as the Daitya. These Setites follow Shiva, who was derived from the god Rudra, a storm deity, and thus identified as being a mask of Set. Believing themselves to be demons in flesh, the Indian Setites see it as their mission to overthrow the gods and take their power for themselves."

Without this, it is argued, they would simply lose themselves in meditation. Without Shiva, they would have no power, and thus it is all attributable to the Dark God in the end."
