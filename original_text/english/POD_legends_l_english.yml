 legend_chronicle_mithras_chronicle: "The Immortal Sun God"
 legend_chronicle_mithras_chronicle_desc: "The tale of the Once and Forever King, Mithras"
 mithras_chronicle_opening: "A God first worshiped by the ancient Persians, Mithras (or Mithra as He was known to them) ruled over the first tribes of men in the Middle East as a firm but fair ruler. Only appearing at night, Mithra devoted his time during the day to chase the night away and bring the glory of the Sun to his faithful followers.\nVenerated as the Sun God, Mithra became a deity of covenants, truth, oath and justice."
 mithras_chronicle_motivation: "Mithras' perfect rule seemed destined to last forever until the coming of another deity, Kemintiri of Egypt. Smitten to have finally found his equal, Mithras invited her to rule by his side. The Sun God offered his friendship too soon however and Kemintiri committed a terrible betrayal, robbing Mithras of his heir and his people of their God. The Sun set over Persia as the Lord of Light fell into despair."
 mithras_chronicle_famous_deed: "Mithras' mourning would come to an end with the coming of the Romans. Taking a keen interest on this warlike people, Mithras revealed himself to them and they fell to their knees, embracing their new God and naming him the Bull Slayer. Following the drive of his new followers, Mithras choose to lead them in battle and, for a time, the world was his."
 mithras_chronicle_extra_deed: "The blessed reign of the Sun God over the Romans came to an end when a rival religion, Christianity, started making headway among the less warlike of the Roman people, a group that Mithras had so far dismissed in favor of the furious zeal of his devoted soldiers. Rather than risk a costly confrontation with this foe and endanger his flock, Mithras took his most faithful with him and embarked for Britain to recreate his utopia in this uncharted land."
 mithras_chronicle_conclusion: "Despite Christianity encroaching even in this new land, Britannia prospered under the Lord of Light's rule, ridding itself of the last barbaric followers of savage religions. Wisely choosing to work alongside the followers of the Cross instead of launching a costly war, Mithras is now subtly pulling the threads of fate that will transform Britannia from a brutish and unconquered land into a world power worthy of being his dominion."

 legend_chronicle_noddist_chronicle: "Caine: The First"
 legend_chronicle_noddist_chronicle_desc: "The tale of the first of your kind, Caine"
 noddist_chronicle_opening: "Caine is widely acknowledged by most as the first vampire.\nIn the earliest days of humankind, the son of Adam and Eve prepared a sacrificial offering to God, of his finest fruits and vegetables. His brother Abel also prepared a sacrificial offering, it being of the finest animals that he had raised. Either there was a dispute over whose offering was better, or God really favored Abel's over Caine's. The final result ended in Caine "sacrificing" Abel on the altar, his brother being the "finest" offering he could give to the almighty, as he loved nothing more than him.\nAs punishment, Cain's father Adam cursed him with a brand upon his flesh, and cast him out to wander in darkness."
 noddist_chronicle_motivation: "Roaming the Land of Nod, Caine encountered Lilith. She noticed a swirling stain in the air around him; a mark of some dark, unfathomable power: murder. He possessed the power to kill higher beings — not to hunt as Adam had, but to kill as had Jehovah.\nShe was amazed, for he bore no signs of godhood, but wandered in the dust like a lesser beast. Seeing that he was cold and hungry, she welcomed Caine into the warmth of her home. Lilith identified herself as the First Woman, the original wife of Caine's father. After staying with her for some time, the two became lovers."
 noddist_chronicle_famous_deed: "After Caine partook of Lilith's blood, he wad visited by three angels in a vision. These angels, who were agents of God, each offered Caine a chance to repent for the murder of his brother Abel, but Caine rebuffed them out of pride, seeing his actions as justified.\nMichael, when denied, cursed Caine and his childer to fear his living flame like no other.\nRaphael cursed Caine and his childer to fear the dawn, as the sun's rays would burn like Michael's holy fire.\nUriel then cursed Caine and his childer to cling to the Darkness, drink only blood, eat only ashes, and be frozen at the point of death, cursed so that all they touched would crumble into nothing.\nA fourth angel, Gabriel, then appeared to offer the way of Golconda, the only way to "light", by the mercy of God."
 noddist_chronicle_extra_deed: "After this experience, Caine became officially "Awakened", possessing the following Disciplines: Celerity, Potence, Fortitude, Obfuscate, Dominate, Presence, Protean, Animalism, and Auspex. Caine then became aware of the Path of Blood, the Final Path from which all paths stem. And with all these powers, he broke his bond with Lilith and left her in the land of Nod."
 noddist_chronicle_conclusion: "Caine continued to wander the Land of Nod in loneliness, the memory of his sin drowning him in sorrow. It was many ages before he decided to be amongst mortal men again. His powers and his mark were well known to mortal men, and some even worshiped him as a god.\nFinally, Caine settled in a small agricultural community, named Ubar. It was here, in this First City, that he became known as the “Dark Father.”"

 legend_chronicle_lilim_chronicle: "Lilith: The First Woman"
 legend_chronicle_lilim_chronicle_desc: "The tale of the first woman, Lilith."
 lilim_chronicle_opening: "According to most early myths, Lilith was the first wife of Adam, his co-equal and counterpart in power and wisdom. She split from the "primordial man", and as punishment God (also known as Jehovah) banished her from Eden, replacing her by making Eve.\nFurthermore, God cursed Lilith to never know the love of another. In turn each being that Lilith truly loved and cared for, could never really love her in return.\nSome Lilith's worshippers claim that Adam attempted to rape Lilith – or he may have actually done so – which prompted Lilith to flee from Eden instead of being banished."
 lilim_chronicle_motivation: "According to the Bahari, however, Lilith enjoyed an extensive sequence of affairs with both Jehovah and Lucifer, who were gods with their own Gardens. Lucifer was said to have given Lilith the "cloak of night" as a gift after she had wandered the lands outside of Eden, scorched and tortured. She plucked stars from her cloak to use as seeds to create her first garden, Elona, the Garden of Hope."
 lilim_chronicle_famous_deed: "Some stories state that Lilith traveled and witnessed the other gardens, but eventually found her way back to Jehovah's garden. Lucifer was sent to block her entry, however, she promised that she only wished to gather information to make her own garden, and would not take anything. Lucifer agreed. While Lilith was in the garden, she transformed into a snake and saw the ignorant Eve, who knew nothing of the world. She gave Eve the fruit, which caused the fall of man, and gave Lilith her curse."
 lilim_chronicle_extra_deed: "Lilith and Lucifer traveled to the edge of the Endless Sea, where they founded D'hainu, the Garden of Renewal.\nEventually abandoned by Jehovah and Lucifer, she met the wandering banished descendant of her ex-husband, the First Murderer (as named in the Bible) Caine. She took Caine in, tended to his injuries, fed and healed him, and taught him secret wisdom – the seeds of which blossomed into the vampiric Disciplines."
 lilim_chronicle_conclusion: "And how does he repay her? By abandoning her as well, to wander forever apart, mother of monsters and thief of infant breaths. Caine goes on to found Enoch and Lilith leaves the scene. She is said, however, to have created a third garden, Ba'hara, the Garden of Sorrows, from which she will prepare for Gehenna."

 legend_chronicle_setite_chronicle: "Set, the Master of Duat"
 legend_chronicle_setite_chronicle_desc: "The tale of the great liberator, Set."
 setite_chronicle_opening: "According to his faithful flock, Set was born in Egypt, on the Nile River, nearly 7,000 years ago. He was a great hunter and warrior whose only rival was his elder brother, Osiris. They were the grandchildren of Ra, a mighty chieftain who had conquered the people of the Nile, thus uniting Upper and Lower Egypt."
 setite_chronicle_motivation: "The death of Set's parents, Geb and Nut, was ordered by Ra who felt that they had betrayed him for having additional offspring. Ra felt threatened by royal bloodlines and commanded that they must not bear children. Set was anguished by the order of his parent's deaths, and his voice in the matter subjected him to banishment. Osiris, on the other hand, possibly out of fear, expressed loyalty to Ra and became heir to the throne."
 setite_chronicle_famous_deed: "After the death of Ra, Osiris took control of the kingdom, deified his grandfather and promoted his worship as a god. Set returned to his brother Osiris, in hopes of reconciling; however, his reigning brother continued the order of banishment. Thereafter, Set took the name "Sutekh" and travelled north to Assyria."
 setite_chronicle_extra_deed: "As the legend continues, Set returned to Egypt and struck down King Osiris and his son Horus. Taking Egypt as his own, Set ruled in power – and perhaps (or perhaps not) sought to free mankind from the bonds of law imposed by Ra. Whatever the truth may be, Horus came back from death as a Mummy and sought vengeance for his father's destruction, ejecting Set from the throne of Egypt and beginning a crusade that would last millennia."
 setite_chronicle_conclusion: "While most Setites agree that Set was a vampire at some point (perhaps until he ascended to Godhood), there are some who reject the notion that their "Founder" was ever mortal, or even embraced. In this interpretation, Osiris, Set and Ra were all truly Gods.\nAnother point of contention arises regarding the role of the "Serpent of Chaos", Apep (or Apophis). Some claim that it was killed by Set (and perhaps absorbed into his being) while other claim that it is instead an ally (or perhaps even master) of their Founder. Both interpretations can hardly coexist and have caused a great deal of theological friction inside the Followers of Set."

 legend_eshu: "[ancestor.GetFirstNameNicknamed]"
 legend_eshu_desc: "After the great God Olorun, the greatest Orisha, conceived of the world and had his two sons, Obatala and Orunmila, design and order it, he sent another Orishas named [ancestor.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], his linguist and messenger, to collect sacrifices for him. Eshu is the orisha with authority over roads and gateways and who loves to cause mischief. He is neither good nor evil, he is simply himself. He plays tricks because it is his way. The good learn from his tricks and the wicked suffer. While on earth he also sired many children who would later become the Eshu, sharing his name and duties. His progeny, unfortunately, happened to steal his name for themselves, if without malice, and when Eshu heard that the mortals were treating his kin as him he new he had to punish his wayward children or others would loose their names as well and the world would be undone. He did this even though he was just a little proud of all his children had accomplished and how much they had learned from him. So, after observing to come up with the best punishment, he called all his children together and told them a great and powerful secret and made them his messengers to the world, commanding them with weighty words to teach their children to follow his ways as well. Then he flew back into the sky laughing. The joke and punishment? He got his kids to do his job for him and to enjoy it."
